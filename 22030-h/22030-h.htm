<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It happened once in Boston, in the year 1861 or 1862, that I
was at a dinner of the Atlantic Club, such as was held every
Saturday, when the question was raised as to whether any man had
ever written a complete and candid autobiography.&nbsp; Emerson,
who was seated by me at the right, suggested the
&ldquo;Confessions&rdquo; of Rousseau.&nbsp; I objected that it
was full of untruths, and that for plain candour it was surpassed
by the &ldquo;Life of Casanova.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this work
(regarding which Carlyle has said, &ldquo;Whosoever has looked
therein, let him wash his hands and be unclean until even&rdquo;)
neither Emerson nor Lowell, nor Palfrey nor Agassiz, nor any of
the others present seemed to have any knowledge, until Dr.
Holmes, who was more adventurous, admitted he knew somewhat
thereof.&nbsp; Now, as I had read it thrice through, I knew it
pretty well.&nbsp; I reflected on this, but came to the
conclusion that perhaps the great reason why the world has so few
and frank autobiographies is really because the world exacts too
much.&nbsp; It is no more necessary to describe everything
cynically than it is to set forth all our petty diseases in
detail.&nbsp; There are many influences which, independent of
passion or shame, do far more to form character.</p>
<p>Acting from this reflection, I wrote this book with no
intention that it should be published; I had, indeed, some idea
that a certain friend might use it after my death as a source
whence to form a Life.&nbsp; Therefore I wrote, as fully and
honestly as I could, <i>everything</i> which I could remember
<!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>which had made me what I am.&nbsp; It occurred to me as
a leading motive that a century or two hence the true inner life
of <i>any</i> man who had actually lived from the time when
railroads, steamboats, telegraphs, gas, percussion-caps,
fulminating matches, the opera and omnibuses, evolution and
socialism were quite unknown to his world, into the modern age,
would be of some value.&nbsp; So I described my childhood or
youth exactly as I recalled, or as I felt it.&nbsp; Such a book
requires very merciful allowance from humane reviewers.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, also, that though I have not lived familiarly
among the princes, potentates, and powers of the earth, yet as I
have met or <i>seen</i> or corresponded with about five hundred
of the three thousand set down in &ldquo;Men of the Time,&rdquo;
and been kindly classed among them, it was worth while to mention
my meetings with many of them.&nbsp; Had the humblest scribbler
of the age of Elizabeth so much as mentioned that he had ever
exchanged a word with, or even looked at, any of the great
writers of his time, his record would now be read with
avidity.&nbsp; I have really never in my life run after such men,
or sought to make their acquaintance with a view of extending my
list; all that I can tell of them, as my book will show, has been
the result of chance.&nbsp; But what I have written will be of
some interest, I think&mdash;at least &ldquo;in the dim and
remote future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had laid the manuscript by, till I had time to quite forget
what I had written, when I unexpectedly received a proposal to
write my memoirs.&nbsp; I then read over my work, and determined
&ldquo;to let it go,&rdquo; as it was.&nbsp; It seemed to me
that, with all its faults, it fulfilled the requisition of
Montaigne in being <i>ung livre de bonne foye</i>.&nbsp; So it
has gone forth into print.&nbsp; <i>Jacta est alea</i>.</p>
<p>The story of what is to me by far the most interesting period
of my life remains to be written.&nbsp; This embraces an account
of my labour for many years in introducing Industrial Art as a
branch of education in schools, my life in England and on the
Continent for more than twenty years, my <!-- page v--><a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>travels in
Russia and Egypt, my researches among Gypsies and Algonkin
Indians, my part in Oriental and Folklore and other Congresses,
my discovery of the Shelta or Ogham tongue in Great Britain, and
the long and very strangely adventurous discoveries, continued
for five years, among <i>witches</i> in Italy, which resulted in
the discovery that all the names of the old Etruscan gods are
still remembered by the peasantry of the Toscana Romagna, and
that ceremonies and invocations are still addressed to
them.&nbsp; All this, however, is still too near to be written
about.&nbsp; But it may perhaps some day form a second series of
reminiscences if the present volumes meet with public favour.</p>
<p>As some of my readers (and assuredly a great many of the
American) will find these volumes wanting in personal adventure
and lively variety of experiences, and perhaps dull as regards
&ldquo;incidents,&rdquo; I would remind them that it is, after
all, only the life of a mere literary man and quiet, humble
scholar, and that such existences are seldom very dramatic.&nbsp;
English readers, who are more familiar with such men or
literature, will be less exacting.&nbsp; What I have narrated is
nowhere heightened in colour, retouched in drawing, or made the
utmost of for effect, and I might have gone much further as
regards my experiences in politics with the <i>Continental
Magazine</i>, and during my connection with Colonel Forney, or
life in the West, and have taken the whole, not more from my
memory than from the testimony of others.&nbsp; But if this work
be, as Germans say, at first too subjective, and devoted too much
to mere mental development by aid of books, the
&ldquo;balance&rdquo; to come of my life will be found to differ
materially from it, though it is indeed nowhere in any passage
exciting.&nbsp; This present work treats of my infancy in
Philadelphia, with some note of the quaint and beautiful old
Quaker city as it then was, and many of its inhabitants who still
remembered Colonial times and Washington&rsquo;s Republican
Court; reminiscences of boyhood in New England; my revolutionary
grandfathers and other relatives, and such men as <!-- page
vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>the
last survivor of the Boston Tea-party (I also saw the last signer
of the Declaration of Independence); an account of my early
reading; my college life at Princeton; three years in Europe
passed at the Universities of Heidelberg, Munich, and Paris, in
what was emphatically the prime of their quaint student-days; an
account of my barricade experiences of the French Revolution of
Forty-Eight, of which I missed no chief scene; my subsequent life
in America as lawyer, man of letters, and journalist; my
experiences in connection with the Civil War, and my work in the
advancement of the signing the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln;
recollections of the Oil Region when the oil mania was at its
height; a winter on the frontier in the debatable land (which was
indeed not devoid of strange life, though I say it); my
subsequent connection for three years with Colonel John Forney,
during which Grant&rsquo;s election was certainly carried by him,
and in which, as he declared, I &ldquo;had been his right-hand
man;&rdquo; my writing of sundry books, such as the
&ldquo;Breitmann Ballads,&rdquo; and my subsequent life in Europe
to the year 1870.</p>
<p>I can enumerate in my memory distinctly half-a-dozen
little-known men whom I have known, and could with time recall
far many more, compared to whose lives my uneventful and calm
career has been as that of the mole before the
eagle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Yet not one of their lives will ever be
written, which is certainly a pity.&nbsp; The practice of writing
real autobiographies is rapidly ceasing in this our age, when it
is bad form to be egoistic or to talk about one&rsquo;s self, and
we are almost shocked in revising those chronicled in the
<i>Causeries de Lundi</i> of Sainte-Beuve.&nbsp; Nowadays we have
good gossipy reminiscences of <i>other</i> people, in which the
writer remains as unseen as the operator of a Punch exhibition in
his <i>schwassel</i> box, while he displays his puppets.&nbsp; I
find no fault with this&mdash;<i>&agrave; chacun sa
mani&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; But it is very natural under such
influences that men whose own lives are full of and inspired with
their <i>own</i> deeds will not write them on the model of
Benvenuto Cellini.&nbsp; One of the greatest generals of modern
<!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>times, Lord Napier of Magdala, told me that he believed
I was the only person to whom he had ever fully narrated his
experiences of the siege of Lucknow.&nbsp; He seemed to be
surprised at having so forgotten himself.&nbsp; In ancient Viking
days the hero made his debut in every society with a &ldquo;<i>Me
voici</i>, <i>mes enfants</i>!&nbsp; Listen if you want to be
astonished!&rdquo; and proceeded to tell how he had smashed the
heads of kings, and mashed the hearts of maidens, and done great
deeds all round.&nbsp; It was bad form&mdash;and yet we should
never have known much about Regner Lodbrog but for such a
canticle.&nbsp; If I, in this work, have not quite effaced
myself, as good taste demands, let it be remembered that if I
had, at the time of writing, distinctly felt that it would be
printed as put down, there would, most certainly, have been much
less of &ldquo;me&rdquo; visible, and the dead-levelled work
would have escaped much possible shot of censure.&nbsp; It was a
little in a spirit of defiant reaction that I resolved to let it
be published as it is, and risk the chances.&nbsp; As Uncle Toby
declared that, after all, a mother must in some kind of a way be
a relation to her own child, so it still appears to me that to
write an autobiography the author must say <i>something</i> about
himself; but it is a great and very popular <i>tour de force</i>
to quite avoid doing this, and all art of late years has run to
merely skilfully overcoming difficulties and avoiding interesting
<i>motives</i> or subjects.&nbsp; It may be, therefore, that in
days to come, my book will be regarded with some interest, as a
curious relic of a barbarous age, and written in a style long
passed away&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When they sat with ghosts on a stormy
shore,<br />
And spoke in a tongue which men speak no more;<br />
Living in wild and wondrous ways,<br />
In the ancient giant and goblin days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once in my younger time, one of the most beautiful and
intellectual women whom I ever knew, Madame Anita de
Barr&eacute;ra&mdash;(Daniel Webster said she was beautiful
enough to redeem a whole generation of blue-stockings from the
charge of ugliness)&mdash;once made a great and pathetic fuss to
me about <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>a <i>grey hair</i> which had
appeared among her black tresses.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
difference,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;can one white hair make to any
friend?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I
thought if I could not awaken any other feeling, I might at least
inspire in you veneration for old age.&rdquo;&nbsp; So with this
work of mine, if it please in naught else, it may still gratify
some who love to trace the footsteps of the past, and listen to
what is told by one who lived long &ldquo;before the
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now for a last word&mdash;which involves the only point of any
importance to me personally in this preface&mdash;I would say
that there will be certain readers who will perhaps think that I
have exaggerated my life-work, or blown my own trumpet too
loudly.&nbsp; To these I declare in plain honesty, that I believe
there have been or are in the United States <i>thousands</i> of
men who have <i>far</i> surpassed me, especially as regards
services to the country during the Civil War.&nbsp; There were
leaders in war and diplomacy, editors and soldiers who sacrificed
their lives, to whose names I can only bow in reverence and
humility.&nbsp; But as it was said of the great unknown who
passed away&mdash;the <i>fortes ante
Agamemnon</i>&mdash;&ldquo;they had no poet, and they
died.&rdquo;&nbsp; These most deserving ones have not written
their lives or set themselves forth, &ldquo;and so they pass into
oblivion&rdquo;&mdash;and I regret it with all my soul.&nbsp; But
this is no reason why those who did something, albeit in lesser
degree, should not chronicle their experiences exactly as they
appear to them, and it is not in human nature to require a man to
depreciate that to which he honestly devoted all his
energies.&nbsp; Perhaps it never yet entered into the heart of
man to conceive how much has really been done by everybody.</p>
<p>And I do most earnestly and solemnly protest, as if it were my
last word in life, that I have said nothing whatever as regards
my political work and its results which was not seriously said at
the time by many far greater men than I, so that I believe I have
not the least exaggerated in any trifle, even
unconsciously.&nbsp; Thus I can never forget the deep and <!--
page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>touching sympathy which Henry W. Longfellow expressed to
me regarding my efforts to advance Emancipation, and how, when
some one present observed that perhaps I would irritate the
Non-Abolition Union men, the poet declared emphatically,
&ldquo;But it is a great idea&rdquo; or &ldquo;a noble
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lowell, Emerson, and George W. Curtis,
Bayard Taylor, and many more, spoke to the same effect.&nbsp; And
what they said of me I may repeat for the sake of History and of
Truth.</p>
<p>The present work describes more than forty years of life in
America, and it is therefore the American reader who will be
chiefly interested in it.&nbsp; I should perhaps have mentioned
what I reserved for special comment in the future: that during
more than ten years&rsquo; residence in Europe I had <i>one thing
steadily in view all the time</i>, at which I worked hard, which
was to qualify myself to return to America and there introduce to
the public schools of Philadelphia the Industrial or Minor Arts
as a branch of education, in which I eventually succeeded,
devoting to the work there four years, applying myself so
assiduously as to neglect both society and amusements, and not
obtaining, nor seeking for, pay or profit thereby in any way,
directly or indirectly.&nbsp; And if I have, as I have read,
since then &ldquo;expatriated&rdquo; myself, my whole absence has
not been much longer than was that of Washington Irving, and I
trust to be able to prove that I have &ldquo;left my country for
my country&rsquo;s good&rdquo;&mdash;albeit in a somewhat better
sense than that which was implied by the poet.</p>
<p>And I may here incidentally mention, with all due modesty,
that since the foregoing paragraph came to me &ldquo;in
revise,&rdquo; I received from Count Angelo di Grubernatis a
letter, beginning with the remark that, in consequence of my
<i>gentile ed insistence prem&uacute;ra</i>, or &ldquo;amiable
persistence, begun four-years ago,&rdquo; he has at length
carried out my idea and suggestion of establishing a great
Italian Folklore Society, of which I am to rank as among the
first twelve members.&nbsp; This is the fourth institution of the
kind which I have been first, or among the first, to found in
Europe, and it has in <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>every case been noted, not without
surprise, that I was an American.&nbsp; Such associations, being
wide-reaching and cosmopolitan, may be indeed considered by every
man of culture as patriotic, and I hope at some future day that I
shall still further prove that, as regards my native country, I
have only changed my sky but not my heart, and laboured for
American interests as earnestly as ever.</p>

<p>I was born on the 15th of August, 1824, in a house which was
in Philadelphia, and in Chestnut Street, the second door below
Third Street, on the north side.&nbsp; It had been built in the
old Colonial time, and in the room in which I first saw life
there was an old chimney-piece, which was so remarkable that
strangers visiting the city often came to see it.&nbsp; It was, I
believe, of old carved oak, possibly medi&aelig;val, which had
been brought from some English manor as a relic.&nbsp; I am
indebted for this information to a Mr. Landreth, who lived in the
house at the time. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>It was then a boarding-house, kept by a Mrs.
Rodgers.&nbsp; She had taken it from a lady who had also kept it
for boarders.&nbsp; The daughter of this latter married President
Madison.&nbsp; She was the well-known &ldquo;Dolly
Madison,&rdquo; famous for her grace, accomplishments, and
<i>belle humeur</i>, of whom there are stories still current in
Washington.</p>
<p>My authority informed me that there were among the boarders in
the house two remarkable men, one of whom often petted me as a
babe, and took a fancy to me.&nbsp; He was a Swedish Count, who
had passed, it was said, a very wild life as pirate for several
years on the Spanish Main.&nbsp; He was identified as the Count
Bruno of Frederica Bremer&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;The
Neighbours.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other was the famous philologist,
Dufief, author of &ldquo;Nature Displayed,&rdquo; a work of such
remarkable ability that I wonder that it should have passed into
oblivion.</p>
<p>My mother had been from her earliest years devoted to
literature to a degree which was unusual at that time in the
United States.&nbsp; She had been, as a girl, a special
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> of Hannah Adams, the author of many
learned works, who was the first person buried in the Mount
Auburn Cemetery of Boston.&nbsp; She directed my mother&rsquo;s
reading, and had great <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>influence over her.&nbsp; My mother
had also been very intimate with the daughters of Jonathan
Russell, the well-known diplomatist.&nbsp; My maternal
grandfather was Colonel Godfrey, who had fought in the war of the
Revolution, and who was at one time an aide-de-camp of the
Governor of Massachusetts.&nbsp; He was noted for the remarkable
gentleness of his character.&nbsp; I have heard that when he went
forth of a morning, all the animals on his farm would run to meet
and accompany him.&nbsp; He had to a miraculous degree a certain
sympathetic power, so that all beings, men included, loved
him.&nbsp; I have heard my mother say that as a girl she had a
tame crow who was named Tom, and that he could distinctly cry the
word &ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp; When Tom was walking about in the
garden, if called, he would reply &ldquo;What?&rdquo; in a
perfectly human manner.</p>
<p>When I was one month old, General Lafayette visited our city
and passed in a grand procession before the house.&nbsp; It is
one of the legends of my infancy that my nurse said,
&ldquo;Charley shall see the General too!&rdquo; and held me up
to the window.&nbsp; General Lafayette, seeing this, laughed and
bowed to me.&nbsp; He was the first gentleman who ever saluted me
formally.&nbsp; When I reflect how in later life adventure, the
study of languages, and a French Revolution came into my
experiences, it seems to me as if Count Bruno, Dufief, and
Lafayette had all been premonitors of the future.</p>
<p>I was a great sufferer from many forms of ill-health in my
infancy.&nbsp; Before my second birthday, I had a terrible
illness with inflammation of the brain.&nbsp; Dr. Dewees (author
of a well-known work on diseases of women and children), who
attended me, said that I was insane for a week, and that it was a
case without parallel.&nbsp; I mention this because I believe
that I owe to it in a degree whatever nervousness and tendency to
&ldquo;idealism&rdquo; or romance and poetry has subsequently
been developed in me.&nbsp; Through all my childhood and youth
its influence was terribly felt, nor have I to this day recovered
from it.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>I should mention that my first nurse in life was an old
Dutch woman named Van der Poel.&nbsp; I had not been born many
days before I and my cradle were missing.&nbsp; There was a
prompt outcry and search, and both were soon found in the garret
or loft of the house.&nbsp; There I lay sleeping, on my breast an
open Bible, with, I believe, a key and knife, at my head lighted
candles, money, and a plate of salt.&nbsp; Nurse Van der Poel
explained that it was done to secure my rising in life&mdash;by
taking me up to the garret.&nbsp; I have since learned from a
witch that the same is still done in exactly the same manner in
Italy, and in Asia.&nbsp; She who does it must be, however, a
<i>strega</i> or sorceress (my nurse was reputed to be one), and
the child thus initiated will become deep in darksome lore, an
adept in <i>occulta</i>, and a scholar.&nbsp; If I have not
turned out to be all of this <i>in majoribus</i>, it was not the
fault of my nurse.</p>
<p>Next door to us lived a family in which were four daughters
who grew up to be famous belles.&nbsp; It is said that when the
poet N. P. Willis visited them, one of these young ladies, who
was familiar with his works, was so overcome that she
fainted.&nbsp; Forty years after Willis distinctly recalled the
circumstance.&nbsp; Fainting was then fashionable.</p>
<p>Among the household friends of our family I can remember Mr.
John Vaughan, who had legends of Priestley, Berkeley, and Thomas
Moore, and who often dined with us on Sunday.&nbsp; I can also
recall his personal reminiscences of General Washington,
Jefferson, and all the great men of the previous
generation.&nbsp; He was a gentle and beautiful old man, with
very courtly manners and snow-white hair, which he wore in a
queue.&nbsp; He gave away the whole of a large fortune to the
poor.&nbsp; Also an old Mr. Crozier, who had been in France
through all the French Revolution, and had known Robespierre,
Marat, Fouquier Tinville, &amp;c.&nbsp; I wish that I had betimes
noted down all the anecdotes I ever heard from them.&nbsp; There
were also two old ladies, own nieces of Benjamin Franklin, who
for many years continually took tea with <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>us.&nbsp; One
of them, Mrs. Kinsman, presented me with the cotton quilt under
which her uncle had died.&nbsp; Another lady, Miss Louisa
Nancrede, who had been educated in France, had seen Napoleon, and
often described him to me.&nbsp; She told me many old French
fairy-tales, and often sang a ballad (which I found in after
years in the works of Cazotte), which made a great impression on
me&mdash;something like that of &ldquo;Childe Roland to the dark
tower came.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was called <i>Le Sieur
Enguerrand</i>, and the refrain was &ldquo;<i>Oh ma bonne
j&rsquo;ai tant peur</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these and many other influences of culture stirred me
strangely even as a child, is evident from the fact that they
have remained so vividly impressed on my memory.&nbsp; This
reminds me that I can distinctly remember that when I was eight
years of age, in 1832, my grandmother, Mrs. Oliver Leland, told
my mother that the great German poet Goethe had recently died,
and that they bade me remember it.&nbsp; On the same day I read
in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (an American reprint of leading
articles, poems, &amp;c., from English magazines, which
grandmother took all her life long) a translation of
Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diver.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read it only once,
and to this day I can repeat nearly the whole of it.&nbsp; I have
now by me, as I write, a silver messenger-ring of King Robert,
and I never see it without thinking of the corner of the room by
the side-door where I stood when grandmother spoke of the death
of Goethe.&nbsp; But I anticipate.</p>
<p>My father was a commission merchant, and had his place of
business in Market Street below Third Street.&nbsp; His partner
was Charles S. Boker, who had a son, George, who will often be
mentioned in these Memoirs.&nbsp; George became in after life
distinguished as a poet, and was Minister for many years at
Constantinople and at St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Rodgers&rsquo; my parents went to Mrs.
Shinn&rsquo;s, in Second Street.&nbsp; It also was a very
old-fashioned house, with a garden full of flowers, and a front
doorstep almost on a level with the ground.&nbsp; The parlour had
a large old fireplace, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>set with blue tiles of the time of
Queen Anne, and it was my delight to study and have explained to
me from them the story of Joseph and his brethren and
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables.&nbsp; Everything connected with this
house recurs to me as eminently pleasant, old-fashioned, and very
respectable.&nbsp; I can remember something very English-like
among the gentlemen-boarders who sat after dinner over their
Madeira, and a beautiful lady, Mrs. Stanley, who gave me a
sea-shell.&nbsp; Thinking of it all, I seem to have lived in a
legend by Hawthorne.</p>
<p>There was another change to a Mrs. Eaton&rsquo;s
boarding-house in Fifth Street, opposite to the side of the
Franklin Library.&nbsp; I can remember that there was a very good
marine picture by Birch in the drawing-room.&nbsp; This was after
living in the Washington Square house, of which I shall speak
anon.&nbsp; I am not clear as to these removals.&nbsp; There were
some men of culture at Mrs. Eaton&rsquo;s&mdash;among them Sears
C. Walker, a great astronomer, and a Dr. Brewer, who had
travelled in Italy and brought back with him pieces of
sculpture.&nbsp; We were almost directly opposite the State
House, where liberty had been declared, while to the side, across
the street, was the Library founded by Dr. Franklin, with his
statue over the door.&nbsp; One of his nieces often told me that
this was an absolutely perfect likeness.&nbsp; The old iron
railing, now removed&mdash;more&rsquo;s the
pity!&mdash;surrounded the Square, which was full of grand
trees.</p>
<p>It was believed that the spirit of Dr. Franklin haunted the
Library, reading the books.&nbsp; Once a coloured woman, who, in
darkey fashion, was scrubbing the floor after midnight, beheld
the form.&nbsp; She was so frightened that she fainted.&nbsp; But
stranger still, when the books were removed to the New Library in
Locust Street, the ghost went with them, and there it still
&ldquo;spooks&rdquo; about as of yore to this day, as every negro
in the quarter knows.</p>
<p>In regard to Franklin and his apparition, there was a
schoolboy joke to this effect: that <i>whenever</i> the statue of
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Franklin over the Library door heard the clock strike
twelve at night, it descended, went to the old Jefferson Wigwam,
and drank a glass of beer.&nbsp; But the sell lay in this, that a
statue cannot hear.</p>
<p>And there was a dim old legend of a colony of Finns, who, in
the Swedish time, had a village all to themselves in
Wiccacoe.&nbsp; They were men of darksome lore and magic skill,
and their women were witches, who at tide and time sailed forth
merrily on brooms to the far-away highlands of the Hudson, where
they held high revel with their Yankee, Dutch, and Indian
colleagues of the mystic spell.&nbsp; David MacRitchie, in a
recent work, has made a note of this curious offshoot of the old
Philadelphia Swedes.</p>
<p>And I can also remember that before a marble yard in Race
Street there were two large statues of very grim
forbidding-looking dogs, of whom it was said that when there was
any one about to die in the quarter, these uncanny hounds came
down during a nightly storm and howled a death duet.</p>
<p>And when I was very young there still lingered in the minds of
those invaluable living chronicles (whether bound in sheepskin or
in calf), the oldest inhabitants, memories from before the
Revolution of the Indian market, when on every Saturday the
natives came from their rural retreats, bringing pelts or skins,
baskets, moccasins, <i>mocos</i> or birch boxes of maple-sugar,
feathers, and game for sale.&nbsp; Then they ranged themselves
all along the west side of Independence Square, in tents or at
tables, and sold&mdash;or were sold themselves&mdash;in
bargains.&nbsp; Even now the Sunday-child, or he who is gifted to
behold the departed, may see the ghostly forms of Red-men
carrying on that weekly goblin market.&nbsp; Miss Eliza
Leslie&rsquo;s memory was full of these old stories, which she
had collected from old people.</p>
<p>As for the black witches, as there were still four negro
sorcerers in Philadelphia in 1883 (I have their addresses), it
may be imagined to what an extent <i>Voodoo</i> still prevailed
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>among our Ebo-ny men and brothers.&nbsp; Of one of these
my mother had a sad experience.&nbsp; We had a black cook named
Ann Lloyd, of whom, to express it mildly, one must say that she
was &ldquo;no good.&rdquo;&nbsp; My mother dismissed her, but
several who succeeded her left abruptly.&nbsp; Then it was found
that Ann, who professed to be a witch, had put a spell of death
on all who should take her place.&nbsp; My mother learned this,
and when the last black cook gave warning she received a good
admonition as to a Christian being a slave to the evil one.&nbsp;
I believe that this ended the enchantment.&nbsp; There is or was
in South Fifth Street an African church, over the door of which
was the charming inscription, &ldquo;Those who have walked in
Darkness have seen a great light.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this light has
not even yet penetrated to the darksome depths of Lombard or
South Streets, if I may believe the strange tales which I have
heard, even of late, of superstition there.</p>
<p>Philadelphia was a very beautiful old-fashioned city in those
days, with a marked character.&nbsp; Every house had its garden,
in which vines twined over arbours, and the magnolia,
honeysuckle, and rose spread rich perfume of summer nights, and
where the humming-bird rested, and scarlet tanager or oriole with
the yellow and blue bird flitted in sunshine or in shade.&nbsp;
Then swallows darted at noon over the broad streets, and the
mighty sturgeon was so abundant in the Delaware that one could
hardly remain a minute on the wharf in early morn or ruddy
evening without seeing some six-foot monster dart high in air,
falling on his side with a plash.&nbsp; In the winter-time the
river was allowed to freeze over, and then every schoolboy walked
across to Camden and back, as if it had been a pilgrimage or
religious duty, while meantime there was always a kind of Russian
carnival on the ice, oxen being sometimes roasted whole, and all
kinds of &ldquo;fakirs,&rdquo; as they are now termed, selling
doughnuts, spruce-beer, and gingerbread, or tempting the
adventurous with thimblerig; many pedestrians stopping at the
old-fashioned inn on Smith&rsquo;s Island for hot punch.&nbsp;
Juleps and cobblers, and the <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>&ldquo;one
thousand and one American fancy drinks,&rdquo; were not as yet
invented, and men drank themselves unto the devil quite as easily
on rum or brandy straight, peach and honey, madeira and punch, as
they now do on more varied temptations.&nbsp; Lager beer was not
as yet in the land.&nbsp; I remember drinking it in after years
in New Street, where a German known as <i>der dicke Georg</i>
first dealt it in 1848 to our American public.&nbsp; Maize-whisky
could then be bought for fifteen cents a gallon; even good
&ldquo;old rye&rdquo; was not much dearer; and the best Havanna
cigars until 1840 cost only three cents a-piece.&nbsp; As they
rose in price they depreciated in quality, and it is now many
years since I have met with a really aromatic old-fashioned
Havanna.</p>
<p>It was a very well-shaded, peaceful city, not &ldquo;a great
village,&rdquo; as it was called by New Yorkers, but like a
pleasant English town of earlier times, in which a certain
picturesque rural beauty still lingered.&nbsp; The grand old
double houses, with high flights of steps, built by the Colonial
aristocracy&mdash;such as the Bird mansion in Chestnut Street by
Ninth Street&mdash;had a marked and pleasing character, as had
many of the quaint black and red-brick houses, whose fronts
reminded one of the chequer-board map of our city.&nbsp; All of
this quiet charm departed from them after they were surrounded by
a newer and noisier life.&nbsp; I well remember one of these fine
old Colonial houses.&nbsp; It had been the old Penington mansion,
but belonged in my early boyhood to Mr. Jones, who was one of my
father&rsquo;s partners in business.&nbsp; It stood at the corner
of Fourth and Race Streets, and was surrounded on all sides by a
garden.&nbsp; There was a legend to the effect that a beautiful
lady, who had long before inhabited the house, had been so fond
of this garden, that after death her spirit was often seen of
summer nights tending or watering the flowers.&nbsp; She was a
gentle ghost, and the story made a great impression on me.&nbsp;
I still possess a pictured tile from a chimney-piece of this old
mansion.</p>
<p>The house is gone, but it is endeared to me by a very <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>strange memory.&nbsp; When I was six or seven years of
age, I had read Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tempest,&rdquo; and
duly reflected on it.&nbsp; The works of Shakespeare were very
rare indeed in Quaker Philadelphia in those days, and much
tabooed, but Mr. Jones, who had a good library in the great hall
upstairs, possessed a set in large folio.&nbsp; This I was
allowed to read, but not to remove from the place.&nbsp; How well
I can remember passing my Saturday afternoons reading those
mighty tomes, standing first on one leg, then on the other for
very weariness, yet absorbed and fascinated!</p>
<p>About this time I was taken to the theatre to see Fannie
Kemble in &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rdquo;&mdash;or it may
have been to a play before that time&mdash;when my father said to
me that he supposed I had never heard of Shakespeare.&nbsp; To
which I replied by repeating all the songs in the
&ldquo;Tempest.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these, referring to the loves
of certain sailors, is not very decent, but I had not the
remotest conception of its impropriety, and so proceeded to
repeat it.&nbsp; A saint of virtue must have laughed at such a
declamation.</p>
<p>As it recurs to me, the spirit which was over Philadelphia in
my boyhood, houses, gardens, people, and their life, was
strangely quiet, sunny, and quaint, a dream of olden time drawn
into modern days.&nbsp; The Quaker predominated, and his memories
were mostly in the past; ours, as I have often said, was a city
of great trees, which seemed to me to be ever repeating their old
poetic legends to the wind of Swedes, witches, and Indians.</p>
<p>Among the street-cries and sounds, the first which I can
remember was the postman&rsquo;s horn, when I was hardly three
years old.&nbsp; Then there were the watchmen, &ldquo;who cried
the hour and weather all night long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also a coloured
man who shouted, in a strange, musical strain which could be
heard a mile:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Tra-la-la-la-la-la-loo</i>.<br />
Le-mon-ice-cream!<br />
An&rsquo;-wanilla-too!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Also the quaint old Hominy-man:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;De Hominy man is on his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frum de Navy-Yard!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wid his harmony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Spoken) &ldquo;Law bess de putty eyes ob de young lady!&nbsp;
Hominy&rsquo;s good fur de young ladies!</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Harmony man is on his way,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, &ldquo;Hot-corn!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pepper-pot!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be-au-ti-ful Clams!&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;Sweep-oh&rdquo; cry, and charcoal and muffin
bells.</p>
<p>One of the family legends was, that being asked by some lady,
for whom I had very little liking, to come and visit her, I
replied with great politeness, but also with marked firmness,
&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, ma&rsquo;am, and thank
you&mdash;but I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Washington Square, three doors from us, at the corner of
Walnut Street, lived Dr. George McClellan.&nbsp; He had two sons,
one, John, of my own age, the other, George, who was three years
younger.&nbsp; Both went to school with me in later years.&nbsp;
George became a soldier, and finally rose to the head of the army
in the first year of the War of Rebellion, or Emancipation, as I
prefer to term it.</p>
<p>Washington Square, opposite our house, had been in the olden
time a Potter&rsquo;s Field, where all the victims of the yellow
fever pestilence had been interred.&nbsp; Now it had become a
beautiful little park, but there were legends of a myriad of
white confused forms seen flitting over it in the night, for it
was a mysterious haunted place to many still, and I can remember
my mother gently reproving one of our pretty neighbours for
repeating such tales.</p>
<p>I have dreamy yet very oft-recurring memories of my life in
childhood, as, for instance, that just before I was quite three
years old I had given to me a copy of the old New England Primer,
which I could not then read, yet learned from others the rhymes
with the quaint little cuts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Adam&rsquo;s fall<br />
We sin-n&egrave;d all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;My book and heart<br />
Shall never part,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also of a gingerbread toy, with much sugar, colour, and
gilding, and of lying in a crib and having the measles.&nbsp; I
can remember that I understood the meaning of the word
<i>dead</i> before that of <i>alive</i>, because I told my nurse
that I had heard that Dr. Dewees was dead.&nbsp; But she replying
that he was not, but alive, I repeated &ldquo;live&rdquo; as one
not knowing what it meant.</p>
<p>I recollect, also, that one day, when poring over the pictures
in a toy-book, my Uncle Amos calling me a good little boy for so
industriously reading, I felt guilty and ashamed because I could
not read, and did not like to admit it.&nbsp; Whatever my faults
or follies may be, I certainly had an innate rectitude, a strong
sense of honesty, just as many children have the contrary; and
this, I believe, is due to inherited qualities, though these in
turn are greatly modified by early association and
influences.&nbsp; That I also had precocious talent and taste for
the romantic, poetic, marvellous, quaint, supernatural, and
humorous, was soon manifested.&nbsp; Even as an infant objects of
<i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i> and of antiquity awoke in me an
interest allied to passion or awe, for which there was no
parallel among others of my age.&nbsp; This was, I believe, the
old spirit which had come down through the ages into my
blood&mdash;the spirit which inspired Leland the <i>Flos
Grammaticorum</i>, and after him John Leland, the antiquary of
King Henry VIII., and Chrs. (Charles) Leland, who was secretary
of the Society of Antiquaries in the time of Charles I.&nbsp; Let
me hereby inform those who think that &ldquo;Chrs.&rdquo; means
Christopher, that there has been a Charles in the family since
time immemorial, alternated with an Oliver since the days of
Cromwell.</p>
<p>John Leyland, an Englishman, now living, who is a deep and
sagacious scholar, and the author of the &ldquo;Antiquities of
the Town of Halifax&rdquo; (a very clever work), declares that
for <i>four hundred years</i> there has not been a generation in
which <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>some Leland (or Leyland) of the old
Bussli de Leland stock has not written a work on antiquity or
allied to antiquarianism, though in one case it is a translation
of Demosthenes, and in another a work on Deistical Writers.&nbsp;
He traces the connection with his own family of the Henry Leland,
my ancestor, a rather prominent political Puritan character in
his time, who first went to America in 1636, and acquired land
which my grandfather still owned.&nbsp; It was very
extensive.</p>
<p>There is a De la Laund in the roll of Battle Abbey, <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> but John says our progenitor was <i>De
Bussli</i>, who came over with the Conqueror, ravaged all
Yorkshire, killing 100,000 men, and who also burned up, perhaps
alive, the 1,000 Jews in the Tower of York.&nbsp; For these
eminent services to the state he was rewarded with the manor of
Leyland, from which he took his name.&nbsp; The very first
<i>complete</i> genealogical register of any American family ever
published was that of the Leland family, by Judge Leland, of
Roxbury, Mass. (but for which he was really chiefly indebted to
another of the name), in which it is shown that Henry Leland had
had in 1847 fifteen thousand descendants in America.&nbsp; In
regard to which I am <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>honoured with a membership in the
Massachusetts Genealogical Society.&nbsp; The crest of Bussli and
the rest of us is a raven or crow transfixed by an arrow, with a
motto which I dearly love.&nbsp; It is <i>Cui debeo</i>,
<i>fidus</i>.&nbsp; Very apropos of this crow or raven is the
following: Heinrich Heine, in his &ldquo;Germany&rdquo; (vol. ii.
p. 211, Heinemann&rsquo;s edition), compares the same to priests
&ldquo;whose pious croaking is so well known to our
ears.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is in reference to such birds which fly
about the mountain of Kyffh&auml;user, in which the Emperor
Friedrich Barbarossa is sleeping, and where he will sleep till
they disappear.&nbsp; And then, praising himself, Heine adds:
&ldquo;But old age has weakened them, and there are good marksmen
who know right well how to bring them down.&nbsp; I know one of
these archers, who now lives in Paris, and who knows how, even
from that distance, to hit the crows which fly about the
Kyffh&auml;user.&nbsp; When the Emperor returns to earth, he will
surely find on his way more than one raven slain by this
archer&rsquo;s arrows.&nbsp; And the old hero will say, smiling,
&lsquo;That man carried a good bow.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; In my
note to this I remarked that &ldquo;the raven or crow transfixed
by an arrow is the crest of the coat-of-arms of the name of
Leland, or of my own.&nbsp; I sincerely trust that Bussli, the
first who bore it, did not acquire the right to do so by shooting
a clergyman.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a single crow is an omen of
ill-luck, so the same transfixed signifies misfortune overcome,
or the forcible ending of evil influences by a strong will.&nbsp;
It is a common belief or saying among all the Lelands, however
widely related, that there has never been a convicted criminal of
the name.&nbsp; <i>Dii faxint</i>!</p>
<p>At four years of age, while still living in Washington Square,
I was sent to an infant school in Walnut Street, above Eighth
Street, south side, near by.&nbsp; It was kept by the Misses
Donaldson.&nbsp; We all sat in a row, on steps, as in an
amphitheatre, but in straight lines.&nbsp; Miss Donaldson,
senior, sat at a desk, prim and perpendicular, holding a rod
which was fifteen or twenty feet in length, with which she could
hit on the head or poke any noisy or drowsy child, without <!--
page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>stirring from her post.&nbsp; It was an ingenious
invention, and one which might be employed to advantage in small
churches.&nbsp; I can remember that at this time I could not hear
a tune played without stringing my thoughts to it; not that I
have any special ear for music, but because I am moved by
melody.&nbsp; There was a rhyme that was often sung to me to the
tune of &ldquo;Over the Water&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Charley Buff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had money enough,<br />
And locked it in his store;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Charley die<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shut his eye,<br />
And never saw money no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The influence of this and other tunes on my thought was so
great, that I have often wondered whether anybody ever realised
how much we may owe to metre acting on thought; for I do not
believe that I ever penned any poetry in my life unless it was to
a <i>tune</i>; and even in this prose which I now write there is
ever and anon a <i>cadence</i> as of a brook running along, then
rising, anon falling, perceptible to me though not to you, yet
which has many a time been noted down by critics speaking gently
of my work.&nbsp; This induced me to learn betimes an incredible
number of songs; in fact, at the age of ten or eleven I had most
of Percy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Relics&rdquo; by heart.&nbsp; This
naturally enough led me to read, and reading understand, an
amount of poetry of such varied character that I speak with
strictest truth in saying that I have never met with, and never
even read of, any boy who, as a mere little boy, had mastered
such a number and variety of ballads and minor poems as I had
done&mdash;as will appear in the course of this narrative.</p>
<p>While living at Mrs. Eaton&rsquo;s I was sent to a school kept
by two very nice rather young Quaker ladies in Walnut
Street.&nbsp; It was just opposite a very quaint old-fashioned
collection of many little dwellings in one (modelled after the
Fuggerei of Augsburg?) known as the Quaker Almshouse.&nbsp; <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>One morning I played truant, and became so fearfully
weary and bored lounging about, that I longed for the society of
school, and never stayed from study any more.&nbsp; Here I was
learning to read, and I can remember &ldquo;The History of Little
Jack,&rdquo; and discussing with a comrade the question as to
whether the word <i>history</i> really meant <i>his</i> story, or
was ingeniously double and inclusive.&nbsp; I also about this
time became familiar with many minor works, such as are all now
sold at high prices as chap-books, such as &ldquo;Marmaduke
Multiply,&rdquo; &ldquo;The World Turned Upside Down,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chrononhotonthologos,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Noble History of
the Giants,&rdquo; and others of Mr. Newberry&rsquo;s gilt-cover
toy-books.&nbsp; All of our juvenile literature in those days was
without exception London made, and very few persons can now
realise how deeply Anglicised I was, and how all this reading
produced associations and feelings which made dwelling in England
in later years seem like a return to a half-forgotten home, of
which we have, however, pleasant fairy-tale reminiscences.</p>
<p>The mistress of the school was named Sarah Lewis, and while
there, something of a very extraordinary nature&mdash;to me, at
least&mdash;took place.&nbsp; One day, while at my little desk,
there came into my head with a strange and unaccountable
intensity this thought: &ldquo;I am I&mdash;I am
<i>Myself</i>&mdash;I myself <i>I</i>,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; By
forcing this thought on myself very rapidly, I produced a
something like suspension of thought or syncope; not a vertigo,
but that mental condition which is allied to it.&nbsp; I have
several times read of men who recorded nearly the same thing
among their youthful experiences, but I do not recall that any of
them induced this <i>coma</i> by reflecting on the ego-ism of the
I, or the me-ness of the Me. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; It often
recurred to me in after years when studying Schelling and <!--
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Fichte, or reading works by Mystics, Quietists, and the
like.&nbsp; At a very early age I was indeed very much given to
indulging in states of mind resembling metaphysical
abstraction&mdash;a kind of vague marvelling what I <i>was</i>
and what others were; whether they and everything were not
spirits playing me tricks, or a delusion&mdash;a kind of
psychology without material or thought, like a workman without
tools.</p>
<p>For a short time, while five or six years old, and living at
Mrs. Eaton&rsquo;s, I was sent to a school of boys of all ages,
kept by a man named Eastburn, in Library Street, whom I can only
recall as a coarse, brutal fiend.&nbsp; From morning to night
there was not a minute in which some boy was not screaming under
the heavy rattan which he or his brother always held.&nbsp; I
myself&mdash;infant as I was&mdash;for not learning a
spelling-lesson properly, was subjected to a caning which would
have been cruel if inflicted on a convict or sailor.&nbsp; In the
lower story this man&rsquo;s sister kept a girls&rsquo; school,
and the ruffian was continually being called downstairs to beat
the larger girls.&nbsp; My mother knew nothing of all this, and I
was ashamed to tell that I had been whipped.&nbsp; I have all my
life been opposed to corporal punishment, be it in schools or for
criminals.&nbsp; It brings out of boys all that is evil in their
nature and nothing that is good, developing bullying and cruelty,
while it is eminently productive of cowardice, lying, and
meanness&mdash;as I have frequently found when I came to hear the
private life of those who defend it as creating
&ldquo;manliness.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was found during the American
war that the soldiers who had been most accustomed to beating and
to being beaten were by far the greatest cowards, and that
&ldquo;Billy Wilson&rsquo;s&rdquo; regiment of pugilists was so
absolutely worthless as to be unqualified for the field at any
time.&nbsp; One thing is very certain, that I have found that
boys who attend schools where there is no whipping, and little or
no fighting, are freest from that <i>coarseness</i> which is so
invariably allied to meanness, lying, and dishonesty.&nbsp; I had
about 2000 children in the <i>public schools</i> of Philadelphia
pass under my teaching, and never <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>met with but
one instance of direct rudeness.&nbsp; There was also only one of
dishonesty or theft, and that was by a fighting boy, who looked
like a miniature pugilist.&nbsp; Philadelphia manners were formed
by Quakers.&nbsp; When I visited, in 1884, certain minor art-work
classes established in the East End of London, Mr. Walter Besant
said to me that I would find a less gentle set of pupils.&nbsp;
In fact, in the first school which I examined, the girls had, the
week before, knocked down, kicked, and trampled on an elderly
lady who had come to teach them art-work out of pure
benevolence.&nbsp; I am often told that whipping put an end to
garroting.&nbsp; If this be true, which it is <i>not</i> (for
garroting was a merely temporary fancy, which died out in America
without whipping), it only proves that the garotters, who were
all fighting and boxing roughs, were mere cowards.&nbsp; Red
Indians never whip children, but they will die under torture
without a groan.</p>
<p>My parents were from Massachusetts, and every summer they
returned to pass several months in or near Boston, generally with
their relatives in Worcester county, in Dedham, in the
&ldquo;Hub&rdquo; itself, or in Milford, Mendon, or Holliston,
the home of my paternal grandfather, Oliver Leland.&nbsp; Thus I
grew to be familiar with New England, its beautiful scenery and
old-fashioned Yankee rural ways.&nbsp; Travelling was then by
stage-coach, and it took two days to go from Philadelphia to
Boston, stopping on the way overnight at Princeton, Perth Amboy,
or Providence.&nbsp; This is to me a very interesting source of
reminiscences.&nbsp; In Dedham, for three summers, I attended
school.&nbsp; I remember that we stayed with Dr. Jeremy Stimson,
who had married a sister of my mother.&nbsp; I studied French;
and can recall that my cousins Caroline and Emily, who were very
beautiful young ladies, generally corrected my exercises.&nbsp; I
was then seven or eight years of age.&nbsp; Also that I was very
much alone; that I had a favourite bow, made by some old Indian;
that I read with great relish &ldquo;Gil Blas&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; and especially books of curiosities
and oddities which had a great influence on me.&nbsp; I wandered
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>for days by myself fishing, strolling in beautiful wild
places among rocks and fields, or in forests by the River
Charles.&nbsp; I can remember how one Sunday during service I sat
in church unseen behind the organ, and read Benvenuto
Cellini&rsquo;s account of the sorcerer in the Colosseum in Rome:
I shall see his Perseus ten minutes hence in the Signoria of
Florence, where I now write.</p>
<p>Then there were the quiet summer evenings in the drawing-room,
where my cousins played the piano and sang &ldquo;The Sunset
Tree,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alknoomuk,&rdquo; &ldquo;I see them on the
winding way,&rdquo; and Moore&rsquo;s melodies.&nbsp; <i>Tempi
passati</i>&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sixty year&rsquo;s
since.&rdquo;&nbsp; Caroline meantime married a Mr. Wight, who
had passed most of his life in England, and was thoroughly
Anglicised.&nbsp; There was also an English lady visiting America
who stayed a while in Dedham to be with my cousin.&nbsp; She was
<i>jeune encore</i>, but had with her a young English gentleman
relative who <i>would</i> call her &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; which we
thought rather <i>niais</i>.&nbsp; From my reading and my few
experiences I, however, acquired a far greater insight into life
than most boys would have done, for I remembered and thought long
over everything I heard or learned.&nbsp; Between my mother and
cousins and our visitors there was much reading and discussion of
literary topics, and I listened to more than any one noted, and
profited by it.</p>
<p>I was always reading and mentally reviewing.&nbsp; If my
mother made a call, I was at once absorbed in the first book
which came to hand.&nbsp; Thus I can remember that one summer,
when we came to Dr. Stimson&rsquo;s, during the brief interval of
our being shown into the &ldquo;parlour,&rdquo; I seized on a
Unitarian literary magazine and read the story of Osapho, the
Egyptian who trained parrots to cry, &ldquo;Osapho is a
god!&rdquo;&nbsp; Also an article on Chinese acupuncture with
needles to cure rheumatism; which chance readings and
reminiscences I could multiply <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>My cousin Caroline, whom I remember as very beautiful and
refined, with a <i>distingu&eacute;e</i> manner, had a small
work-box, <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>on the cover of which was a picture
of the Pavilion in Brighton.&nbsp; She spoke of the building as a
rubbishy piece of architecture; but I, who felt it through the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; admired it, and pitied her want of
taste.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> I have lived altogether three years in
Brighton, but I never saw the Pavilion without recalling the
little yellow work-box.&nbsp; In some mysterious way the picture
seems to me to be grander than the original.&nbsp; Dickens has
expressed this idea.&nbsp; I was too grave and earnest as a child
to be called a cheerful or happy one, which was partly due to
much ill-health; yet, by a strange contradiction not uncommon in
America, I was gifted with a precociously keen sense of humour,
and not only read, but collected and preserved every comic
almanac and scrap of droll anecdote which I could get.&nbsp; Thus
there came into my possession half-a-dozen books of the broadest
London humour of the time, all of which entered into my soul;
such things as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ladies in furs and gemmen in
spurs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lollop and lounge all day;<br />
The Bazaar in Soho is completely the go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk into the shop of Grimaldi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reader mine, you can have no conception how deeply I, as a
mere little boy, entered into and knew London life and society
from such songs, sketches, anecdotes, books, and caricatures as I
met with.&nbsp; Others read and forget them, but I took such
trifles deep into my soul and <i>dwelt</i> on them.&nbsp; It is
only of late years, since I have lived in England, that I have
learned how extensively&mdash;I may say incredibly well&mdash;I
was informed for my age as to many phases of English life.&nbsp;
Few of us know what may be got out of reading the current light
literature of the day, if we only read it <i>earnestly</i> and
get it by heart.&nbsp; This I did to a great extent, as my
reminiscences continually awakened in England prove.</p>
<p>There was in Dedham a very old house of somewhat superior
style, which had been built, if not in 1630, at least within a
very few years after.&nbsp; It was inhabited by three sisters
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>named Fairbanks, who were very peculiar indeed, and
their peculiarity consisted in a strange devotion to the past,
and above all to old <i>English</i> memories of colonial times
before the Revolution.&nbsp; Even in England this resistance can
hardly be understood at the present day, and yet it may still be
found alive in New England.&nbsp; In the house itself was a well,
dug to supply water when besieged by Indians, and the old ladies
used to exhibit an immense old gun once used by Puritans, and an
ox-saddle and other relics.&nbsp; They had also a very ancient
book of prayer of the Church of England, and an old Bible, and
thereby hangs a tale.&nbsp; They were all still living in 1849 or
1850, when I visited them with my very pretty cousin Mary
Elizabeth Fisher, and as I professed the Episcopal faith, and had
been in England, the precious relics were shown to me as to one
of the initiated.&nbsp; But they showed a marked aversion to
letting Miss Fisher see them, as she was a Unitarian.&nbsp; So
they went on, as many others did in my youth, still staunch
adherents to England, nice old Tories, believers in the King or
Queen, for whom they prayed, and not in the President.&nbsp; I
remember that Miss Eliza Leslie told me in later years of just
such another trio.</p>
<p>My grandfather in Holliston was, as his father and brothers
and uncles had all been, an old Revolutionary soldier, who had
been four years in the war and taken part in many battles.&nbsp;
He had been at Princeton (where I afterwards graduated) and
Saratoga, and witnessed the surrender of Burgoyne to Gates.&nbsp;
I was principally concerned to know whether the conqueror had
<i>kept the sword</i> handed to him on this occasion, and was
rather disappointed to learn that it was given back.&nbsp; Once I
found in the garret a bayonet which my grandma said had been
carried by grandfather in the war.&nbsp; I turned it with a
broom-handle into a lance and made ferocious charges on the cat
and hens.</p>
<p>This grandfather, Oliver Leland, exerted an extraordinary
influence on me, and one hard to describe.&nbsp; He was great,
grim, and taciturn to behold, yet with a good heart, and not <!--
page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>devoid of humour.&nbsp; He was gouty, and yet not
irritable.&nbsp; He continually recurs to me while reading
Icelandic sagas, and as a kind of man who would now be quite out
of the age anywhere.&nbsp; All his early associations had been of
war and a half-wild life.&nbsp; He was born about 1758, and
therefore in a rude age in rural New England.&nbsp; He, I may
say, deeply interested me.</p>
<p>All boys are naturally full of the romance of war; the
Revolution was to us more than the Crusades and all chivalry
combined, and my grandfather was a living example and chronicle
of all that I most admired.&nbsp; Often I sat on a little cricket
at his feet, and listened to tales of battles, scoutings, and
starving; how he had been obliged to live on raw wheat, which
produced evil results, and beheld General Washington and other
great men, and had narrow escapes from Indians, and been at the
capturing of a fort by moonlight, and seen thousands of
pounds&rsquo; worth of stores destroyed.&nbsp; I frequently
thought of old grandfather Oliver when &ldquo;out&rdquo; myself
during the Civil War, and was half-starved and chilled when
scouting, or when doing rough and tough in West Virginia.</p>
<p>My grandfather often told me such stories of the war, and
others of his father and grandfather, who had fought before him
in the old French war in Canada, and how the latter, having gone
up to trade among the Indians one winter, endeared himself so
much to them that they would not let him go, and kept him a
captive until the next summer.&nbsp; I came across traces of this
ancestor in an old Canadian record, wherein it appears that he
once officiated as interpreter in the French and Indian
tongues.&nbsp; Whereby critics may remark that learning French
and Algonkin runs in our blood, and that my proclivity for
Indians is legitimately inherited.&nbsp; I would that I knew all
the folklore that my great-grandsire heard in the Indian wigwams
in those old days!</p>
<p>I can remember seeing my grandfather once sitting and talking
with five other veterans of the war.&nbsp; But I saw them daily
in those times, and once several hundreds, or it may be <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>thousands, of them in a great procession in Philadelphia
in 1832.&nbsp; And here I may mention that in 1834 I often saw
one named Rice, whose age, as authenticated by his pension
papers, was 106, and that in 1835 I shook hands with Thomas
Hughes, aged 95, who was the last survivor of the Boston Tea
party.&nbsp; He had come to visit our school, and how we boys
cheered the old gentleman, who was in our eyes one of the
greatest men alive!&nbsp; But all the old folk in my boyhood
could tell tales of the Revolution, which was indeed not very
much older then than the Rebellion is to us now.</p>
<p>I can also recollect seeing Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the
last of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, though my
memory of the man is now confused with that of a very perfect
portrait which belonged to his granddaughter, Mrs. Jackson, who
was a next-door but one neighbour in after years in Walnut
Street, Philadelphia.&nbsp; He was a very venerable-looking
man.</p>
<p>My father served for a short time in the war of 1812, and I
have heard him relate that when the startling news of peace
arrived in Boston, where he was, he at once took a sleigh and
fast horses and drove full speed, being the first to disseminate
the news in the country.&nbsp; That was as good as
Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ride to Ghent&rdquo; in its
way&mdash;<i>apropos</i> of which Mr. Browning once startled me
by telling me, &ldquo;I suppose you know that it is an invention
of mine, and not founded on any real incident.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
my father&rsquo;s headlong sleigh-ride&mdash;he was young and
wild in those days&mdash;was real and romantic enough in all
conscience.&nbsp; It set bells to ringing, multitudes to
cheering, bonfires a-blazing on hills and in towns, and also some
few to groaning, as happened to a certain old deacon, who had
invested his all in English goods, and said, when he heard the
cheers caused by the news, &ldquo;Wife, if that&rsquo;s war news,
I&rsquo;m saved; but if it&rsquo;s peace, I&rsquo;m
ruined!&rdquo;&nbsp; Even so it befell me, in after years, to be
the first person to announce in the United States, far in advance
of any others, the news of the French Revolution of 1848, as I
shall fully prove in the sequence.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>It may be here remarked, that, though not
&ldquo;professionals,&rdquo; all of our family, without a break
in the record, have successively taken turns at fighting, and
earned our pay as soldiers, since time lost in oblivion; for I
and my brother tried it on during the Rebellion, wherein he
indeed, standing by my side, got the wound from a shell of which
he eventually died; while there were none who were not in the old
Indian wars or the English troubles of Charles the Second and
First, and so on back, I dare say, to the days of Bussli de
Leland, who laid all Yorkshire waste.</p>
<p>My grandfather, though not wealthy, owned a great deal of
land, and I can remember that he one afternoon showed me a road,
saying that he owned the land on each side for a mile.&nbsp; I
myself, in after years, however, came to own in fee-simple a
square mile of extremely rich land in Kansas, which I sold for
sixteen hundred dollars, while my grandfather&rsquo;s was rather
of that kind by which men&rsquo;s poverty was measured in
Virginia&mdash;that is to say, the more land a man had the poorer
he was considered to be.&nbsp; It is related of one of these that
he once held great rejoicing at having got rid of a vast property
by the ingenious process of giving some person one half of it to
induce him to take the other.&nbsp; However, as there is now a
large town or small city on my grandfather&rsquo;s whilom estate,
I wish that it could have been kept.&nbsp; <i>Mais o&ugrave; sont
les neiges d&rsquo;antan</i>, or the ducats of Panurge?</p>
<p>There was a &ldquo;home-pasture,&rdquo; a great field behind
my grandfather&rsquo;s house, where I loved to sit alone, and
which has left a deep impression on my memory, as though it were
a fairy-haunted or imagined place.&nbsp; It was very rocky, the
stones being covered with clean, crisp, dry lichens, and in one
spot there was the gurgling deep down in some crevice of a
mysterious unseen spring or rivulet.&nbsp; Young as I was, I had
met with a line which bore on it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Deep from their vaults the Loxian murmurs
flow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there was something very voice-like or human in this <!--
page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>murmur or chattering of the unseen brook.&nbsp; This I
distinctly remember, that the place gave me not only a feeling,
but a faith that it was haunted by something gentle and
merry.&nbsp; I went there many a time for company, being much
alone.&nbsp; An Indian would have told me that it was the <i>Un
&agrave; games-suk</i>&mdash;the spirit-fairies of the rock and
stream.&nbsp; These beings enter far more largely, deeply, and
socially into their life or faith than elves or fairies ever did
into those of the Aryan races, and I might well have been their
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, for there could have been few
little boys living, so fond as I was of sitting all alone by rock
and river, hill and greenwood tree.&nbsp; There are yet in
existence on some of this land which was once ours certain
mysterious walls or relics of heavy stone-work, which my friend
Eben C. Horsford thinks were made by the Norsemen.&nbsp; I hope
that they were, for I have read many a saga in Icelandic, old
Swedish, and Latin, and the romance thereof is deep in my soul;
and as my own name is Godfrey, it is no wonder that the god Frey
and his Freya are dear to me.&nbsp; In my boyhood&mdash;and it
may be still the case&mdash;the &ldquo;Injuns&rdquo; got the
credit of having built these mysterious works.</p>
<p>Not far from Holliston is Mendon, where I had an uncle, Seth
Davenport, who had a large, pleasant, old-fashioned New England
farm, which was more productive than my grandfather&rsquo;s,
since there were employed on it sixteen men, three of whom were
Natick Indians of the old local stock.&nbsp; There were many of
them when my mother was young, but I suppose that the last of the
tribe has long since died.&nbsp; One of these Indians, Rufus
Pease, I can recall as looking like a dark-ruddy gypsy, with a
pleasant smile.&nbsp; He very was fond of me.&nbsp; He belonged
to a well-known family, and had a brother&mdash;and thereby hangs
a tale, or, in this case, a scalp-lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marm&rdquo; Pease, the mother of Rufus, had on one
occasion been confined, and old Doctor&mdash;I forget his
name&mdash;who officiated at the birth, had been asked to give
the infant a <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>name.&nbsp; Now he was a dry wag, of
the kind so dear to Dr. Holmes, and expressed much gratification
and gratitude at such a compliment being paid to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He had long been desirous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of
naming a child after his dear old friend, Dr. Green.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So the name was bestowed, the simple Indians not realising for
some time after the christening that their youngest bore the name
of Green Pease.&nbsp; Whether he was ever called a duck, I know
not.</p>
<p>Everything about Uncle Seth and Aunt Betsy was, as I remember,
delightfully comfortable, old-fashioned, and in a way
beautiful.&nbsp; There was their daughter Rebecca, who was pretty
and gentle, so that several wild birds came every morning to feed
from her hand and perch on her fingers.&nbsp; Uncle Seth himself
wore a scarlet waistcoat, and, as I recall him, seemed altogether
in figure to belong to the time of Cromwell, or to earlier
days.&nbsp; There was a hall, hung round with many old family
portraits in antique dresses, and an immense dairy&mdash;the
pride of Aunt Betsy&rsquo;s heart&mdash;and a garden, in which I
was once shown a humming-bird&rsquo;s nest; and cousin
Rebecca&rsquo;s mantelpiece, over a vast old fireplace, heaped
with mosses, birds&rsquo; nests, shells, and such curiosities as
a young girl would gather in the woods and fields; and the
cider-press, in which Uncle Seth ground up the sixteen hundred
bushels of apples which he had at one crop, and the new cider
gushing in a stream, whereof I had a taste.&nbsp; It was a
charming, quiet old homestead, in which books and culture were
not wanting, and it has all to me now something of the
chiaroscuro and Rembrandt colour and charm of the
<i>M&auml;hrchen</i> or fairy-tale.&nbsp; The reality of this
charm is apt to go out of life as that of literature or culture
comes in.&nbsp; To this day I draw the deepest impression or
sentiment of the <i>pantheism</i> or subtle spiritual charm of
Nature far more from these early experiences of rural life than
from all the books, poetry included, which I have ever
perused.&nbsp; Note this well, ye whose best feelings are only a
<i>rechauff&eacute;</i> of Ruskin and Browning&mdash;<i>secundem
ordinem</i>&mdash;for I observe <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>that those
who do not think at second hand are growing rare.</p>
<p>In the town of Milford lived my uncle, William Godfrey, with
my aunt Nancy, and of them and their home I have many pleasant
memories.&nbsp; The very first of them all was not so pleasant to
me at the time.&nbsp; My parents had just arrived, and had not
been ten minutes in the house ere a tremendous squall was heard,
and my mother, looking from the window, beheld me standing in the
open barn-door holding a tiny chicken in my right hand, while an
old hen sat on my head flapping her wings and pecking me in
wrath.&nbsp; I, seeing the brood, had forthwith captured one, and
for that was undergoing penance.&nbsp; It was a beautiful
tableau, which was never forgotten!&nbsp; We went there on visits
for many summers.&nbsp; Uncle William was a kind-hearted,
&ldquo;sportive&rdquo; man, who took <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>,
and I can remember that there was a good supply of English
reading in the house.&nbsp; My uncle had three sons, all much
older than I.&nbsp; The eldest, Stearns, was said to have first
popularised the phrase &ldquo;posted up,&rdquo; to signify
well-informed.&nbsp; The second, Benjamin, became in after years
a great manufacturer and somewhat noted politician, and owner of
a famous racehorse.&nbsp; The third, Samuel, went into business
in Philadelphia, and crossed the Atlantic with me.&nbsp; He died
quite young.&nbsp; All of them, like their father and
grandfather, were very good-natured or gentle, and men of perfect
integrity.&nbsp; The Lelands, however, were rather <i>dour</i>
and grim in their honesty, or more Northern than the
Godfreys.&nbsp; This was accounted for by the fact, that while my
father&rsquo;s family was Puritan of the purest, and only
intermarried with Puritan stock, the Godfreys had in Rhode Island
received an infusion of French Huguenot blood, which was indeed
very perceptible in their faces and lively pleasant manner.</p>
<p>There was a strange tradition, to which my mother sometimes
jestingly referred, that there had been among her Rhode Island
ancestors a High German (<i>i.e.</i>, not a Hollander) doctor,
who had a reputation as a sorcerer or wizard.&nbsp; <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>He
was a man of learning, but that is all I ever heard about
him.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s opinion was that this was a very
strong case of atavism, and that the mysterious ancestor had
through the ages cropped out again in me.&nbsp; Something tells
me that this was the High German doctor who, according to
Washington Irving, laid the mystic spell on Sleepy Hollow, which
made of it such a pleasant, ancient, dreamy fairy-land.&nbsp;
Whether his friendly spirit still watches over me, or whether I
am the man himself, is a problem which I leave to my friend
Francis Galton, who indeed personally often reminds me of
Irving.&nbsp; High German sorcerers were not common in those days
north of Pennsylvania, so that I trow mine was the very man
referred to by Geoffrey Crayon.&nbsp; And it is true beyond all
doubt that even in infancy, as I have often heard, there was a
quaint uncanniness, as of something unknown, in my nature, and
that I differed in the main totally from every relative, and
indeed from any other little boy, known to anybody; though I was
a perfect Godfrey in face when very young, as I am now a typical
Leland.&nbsp; I was always given to loneliness in gardens and
woods when I could get into them, and to hearing words in
birds&rsquo; songs and running or falling water; and I once
appalled a visitor by professing seriously that I could determine
for him some question as to what would happen to him by
divination with a bullet in an Indian moccasin.&nbsp; We had two
servants who spoke old Irish; one was an inexhaustible mine of
legends, which she related to me&mdash;she surpassed Croker; the
other, less versed, still knew a great deal, and told me how her
own father, Jackey Mooney, had seen the fairies with his own
eyes.&nbsp; Both of these sincerely and seriously regarded me as
&ldquo;gifted&rdquo; or elfin-favoured, and the latter said in
proof thereof, &ldquo;Only listen to his voice; sure whin he
spakes he&rsquo;d while a burred aff a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; For my
uncanny ways made a deep impression on them, as also on the
darkies.</p>
<p>Once I had a wonderful dream.&nbsp; I thought that I was in
Dr. Furness&rsquo;s chapel, but that, instead of the gentle
reverend <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>clergyman, the devil himself was in
the pulpit preaching.&nbsp; Feeling myself inspired, I went up
into the pulpit, threw the Evil One out, and preached myself in
his place.&nbsp; Now our nurse had a dream-book, and made some
pretence to mystic fairy knowledge learned in Kilkenny, and she
interpreted this dream as signifying that I would greatly rise in
this world, and do strange things.&nbsp; But she was greatly
struck with such a vision in such an infant.</p>
<p>Now, I was a great reader of Scripture; in fact, I learned a
great deal too much of it, believing now that for babes and
sucklings about one-third of it had better be expurgated.&nbsp;
The Apocrypha was a favourite work, but above all I loved the
Revelations, a work which, I may say by the way, is still a
treasure to be investigated as regards the marvellous mixture of
Neo-Platonic, later Egyptian (or Gnostic), and even Indian
Buddhistic ideas therein.&nbsp; Well, I had learned from it a
word which St. John applies (to my mind very vulgarly and much
too frequently) to the Scarlet Lady of Babylon or Rome.&nbsp;
What this word meant I did not know, but this I understood, that
it was &ldquo;sass&rdquo; of some kind, as negroes term it, and
so one day I applied it experimentally to my nurse.&nbsp; Though
the word was not correctly pronounced, for I had never heard it
from anybody, its success was immediate, but not agreeable.&nbsp;
The passionate Irish woman flew into a great rage and declared
that she would &ldquo;lave the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; My mother,
called in, investigated the circumstances, and found that I
really had no idea whatever of the meaning of what I had
said.&nbsp; Peace was restored, but Annie declared that only the
divil or the fairies could have inspired such an infant to use
such language.</p>
<p>I was very fond of asking my nurse to sing in old Irish or to
teach me Irish words.&nbsp; This she did, but agreed with her
sister Biddy that it was all very uncanny, and that there must
have been a time when I was perfectly familiar with the owld
language, as I had such unearthly fondness for it.</p>
<p>I must have been about seven years old when my parents <!--
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>took a house in Arch Street, above Ninth Street,
Philadelphia.&nbsp; Here my life begins to be more marked and
distinct.&nbsp; I was at first sent, <i>i.e.</i>, walked daily to
the school of Jacob Pierce, a worthy Quaker, who made us call him
Jacob, and who carefully taught us all the ordinary branches, and
gave us excellent lectures on natural philosophy and chemistry
with experiments, and encouraged us to form mineralogical
collections, but who objected to our reading history,
&ldquo;because there were so many battles in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
which system of education all that is good and bad, or rather
<i>weak</i>, in Quakerism is fully summed up.&nbsp; Like the
Roman Catholic, it is utterly unfit for <i>all</i> the world, and
incapable of grappling with or adapting itself to the natural
expansion of science and the human mind.&nbsp; Thus the Quaker
garb, which was originally intended by its simplicity to avoid
the appearance of eccentricity or peculiarity (most dress in the
time of the Stuarts being extravagant), has now become, by merely
sticking to old custom, the most eccentric dress known.&nbsp; The
school was in a very large garden, in which was a gymnasium, and
in the basement of the main building there was a
carpenter&rsquo;s shop with a turning-lathe, where boys were
allowed to work as a reward for good conduct.</p>
<p>I could never learn the multiplication table.&nbsp; There are
things which the mind, like the stomach, spasmodically rejects
without the least perceptible cause or reason.&nbsp; So I have
found it to be with certain words which <i>will</i> not be
remembered.&nbsp; There was one Arab word which I verily believe
I looked out one hundred times in the dictionary, and repeated a
thousand, yet never could keep it.&nbsp; Every teacher should be
keen to detect these antipathies, and cure them by gentle and
persuasive means.&nbsp; Unfortunately no one in my youth knew any
better way to overcome them than by &ldquo;keeping me in&rdquo;
after school to study, when I was utterly weary and worn&mdash;a
very foolish punishment, as is depriving a boy of his meals, or
anything else levelled at Nature.&nbsp; I think there must have
been many months of time, and of <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>as much vain
and desperate effort on my part to remember, wasted on my early
arithmetic.&nbsp; Now I can see that by <i>rewards</i> or
inducements, and by the very simple process of only learning
&ldquo;one time one is one&rdquo; for the first lesson, and that
and one line more for the second, I could have mastered the whole
book in time.&nbsp; But oh! the weary, dreary days, and the sad
waste of time, and the anxious nervous suffering, which
arithmetic cost me in my youth, and mathematics in after
years!</p>
<p>But there was one class at Jacob&rsquo;s in which I was
<i>facile-princeps</i> and habitual past-grand-master.&nbsp; This
was the class which was, like the professorship of Diogenes
Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh, for Matters and Things in General.&nbsp; That
is to say, we read aloud from some book&mdash;it may have been
selections from English writers&mdash;and then Jacob, picking out
the hard words or facts or phrases, required of them definition
or explanation.&nbsp; One day there arose in these questions a
sum in arithmetic, when I shot down to the tail of the class as a
plummet drops to the bottom of the well.&nbsp; I shall never
forget the proud fierce impatience which I felt, like an
imprisoned chieftain who knows that he will speedily be delivered
and take dire vengeance on his foes.&nbsp; I had not long to
wait.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Refectory,&rsquo; what is a
&lsquo;refectory&rsquo;?&nbsp; Hillburn Jones, does thee
know?&nbsp; Joseph Widdifield, does thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; But none
of them knew till it came to me &ldquo;down tail,&rdquo; when I
cried &ldquo;An oyster-cellar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is quite
right, Charley; thee can go up head,&rdquo; said Jacob, and as I
passed Hillburn Jones he whispered, half in fun, half enviously,
the &ldquo;Kemble Refectory.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was an
oyster-cellar which had been recently opened under the Arch
Street Theatre, and whence Hillburn and I had derived our
knowledge of the word, the difference being that I remembered
more promptly and risked more boldly.&nbsp; But I missed it one
day when I defined a <i>peasant</i> as &ldquo;a nest full of
young birds;&rdquo; the fact being that I recalled a picture in
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables, and confused <i>peasant</i> with
<i>pheasant</i>.&nbsp; One day Jacob rebuked the class for
letting me <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>always be at their head, when
Hillburn Jones, who was a very honest little boy, said,
&ldquo;Indeed, Jacob, thee must know that all that we do know,
Charley tells us.&rdquo;&nbsp; For I was already an insatiable
reader, and always recalling what I read, and always
communicating my knowledge to others in the form of small
lectures.&nbsp; I had a book of Scripture stories, with a picture
of Pharaoh in his chariot, with the title, &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s
host sunk in the Red Sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence I concluded that a
<i>host</i> was a vehicle of a very superior description.&nbsp; A
carriage-builder in our neighbourhood had executed a chaise of
very unusual magnificence, and as I stood admiring it I informed
Hillburn that this was what was called by the learned a
<i>host</i>, and that it was in such a host that Pharaoh
perished.&nbsp; I remember elevating my voice somewhat for the
benefit of a bystander, being somewhat proud of this bit of
knowledge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not only my father, but also my teacher, and
with them the entire population of North America, in those days
regarded a good knowledge of arithmetic as forming nine-tenths of
all that was most needful in education, while indulgence in a
taste for general information, and &ldquo;literature&rdquo;
especially, was glared at with a very evil eye indeed, as tending
to injure a &ldquo;practical business man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
there could be any kind of profitable or respectable calling not
based upon arithmetic did not enter into the heart of man to
conceive, while among the bankers and merchants of Boston, New
York, or Philadelphia there was a deeply-seated conviction that
even a wealthy and successful editor, literary man, or artist,
was really an inferior as compared to themselves.&nbsp; As this
sublime truth was severely rubbed into me several times daily
during the greater portion of my youthful life, and as in its
earlier stage I rarely met with a man grown who did not look down
on me as an unfortunate non-arithmetical, unbusinesslike
creature, and let me know it too, I very naturally grew up with a
low estimate of my own capacities; and as I was proud and
sensitive, this was to me <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>a source of
much suffering, which often became terrible as I advanced in
years.&nbsp; But at that time the position of the literary man or
scholar, with the exception of a very few brilliant magnates who
had &ldquo;made money,&rdquo; was in the United States not an
enviable one.&nbsp; Serious interest in art and letters was not
understood, or so generally sympathised with, as it now is in
&ldquo;Quakerdelphia.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a gentleman in
Philadelphia who was a scholar, and who having lived long abroad,
had accumulated a very curious black-letter and <i>rariora</i>
library.&nbsp; For a long time I observed that this library was
never mentioned in polite circles without significant
smiles.&nbsp; One day I heard a lady say very meaningly, &ldquo;I
suppose that you know what kind of books he has <i>and how he
obtained them</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; So I inquired very naturally if
he had come by them dishonestly.&nbsp; To which the reply,
half-whispered in my ear lest it should be overheard, was,
&ldquo;They say his books are all <i>old</i> things, which he did
not buy at any first-class stores, but picked up at old stalls
and in second-hand shops at less than their value; in fact,
<i>they did not cost him much</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet these remarks must not be regarded as too sweeping or
general.&nbsp; Firstly, I am speaking of sixty years since.&nbsp;
Secondly, there were many people of literary tastes in
Philadelphia&mdash;a little isolated, it is true; and finally,
there was a great culture of science, founded by Franklin, and
fostered by the medical schools.&nbsp; I could cite a brilliant
array of names of men distinguished in these matters.&nbsp; What
I am writing is simply a sincere record of my own&mdash;somewhat
peculiar&mdash;or personal experiences.&nbsp; There are doubtless
many who would write very differently.&nbsp; And now times are
<i>very</i> greatly changed.</p>
<p>I have again a quaint early reminiscence.&nbsp; It would
happen that now and then a new carriage, always of the same sober
description, with two very good, but seldom showy, horses would
appear in the streets.&nbsp; Then its owner would be greeted on
Market Street with the remark, &ldquo;Well, Sammy, <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>I see
thee&rsquo;s got thee fifty thousand dollars.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
sum&mdash;ten thousand pounds&mdash;constituted the
millionaireism or moneyed aristocracy of those days.&nbsp; On it,
with a thriving business, Samuel could maintain a family in good
fashion, and above all, in great comfort, which was sensibly
regarded as better than fashion or style.&nbsp; Fifty thousand
dollars entitled a man to keep a carriage and be classed as
&ldquo;quality&rdquo; by the negroes.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that although the Quakers did not allow
the piano in their families, as being too worldly, they
compromised by having musical boxes.&nbsp; And I have heard that
in the country, where still older fashioned ideas prevailed, the
one bit of finery allowed to a Quaker damsel was a red ribbon;
but it must be red, not of any other colour.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that at this time Philadelphia, and even
the world, were as yet to a great degree in the Middle Ages as
compared to the present day.&nbsp; We had few steamboats, and no
railroads, or telephones, or percussion-caps, or a tremendous
press, or Darwinism, or friction matches.&nbsp; Even the
introduction of ice-cream, and stone coal as fuel, and grates was
within the memory of our elders.&nbsp; Apropos of matches, the
use of tinderbox and brimstone matches was universal; bold young
men had tinder pistols; but the wood fire was generally kept
under ashes all night, and I can well remember how our negro
servants, when it had gone out, were used early on winter
mornings to borrow a shovelful of coals from the cook of our
next-door neighbour, and how it was handed over the garden fence,
the recipient standing on our pump handle and the donor on
hers.</p>
<p>I forget in what year the railroad (with locomotives) was
first built from Philadelphia to Columbia, a distance of sixty
miles.&nbsp; I believe it was the first real road of the kind in
America.&nbsp; On the day when the first train ran, the City
Council and certain honoured guests made the journey, and among
them was my father, who took me with him.&nbsp; There were only a
few miles of the road then completed.&nbsp; It was a stupendous
marvel to me, and all this being drawn by steam, <!-- page
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and
by a great terrible iron monster of a machine.&nbsp; And there
was still in all souls a certain unearthly awe of the recently
invented and as yet rather rare steamboats.&nbsp; I can
(strangely enough) still recall this feeling by a mental
effort&mdash;this meeting the Horror for the first time!&nbsp; My
father remembered, and had been in the first steamboat which was
a success on the Delaware.&nbsp; I saw its wreck in after years
at Hoboken.&nbsp; The earlier boat made by John Fitch is still
preserved in Bordentown.</p>
<p>I can remember that when gas was introduced to light the city,
it was done under a fearful opposition.&nbsp; All the principal
people signed a petition against it.&nbsp; I saw the paper.&nbsp;
It would burst and kill myriads; it was poisonous; and, finally,
it would ruin the oil trade.&nbsp; However, we got it at
last.&nbsp; Somebody had invented hand gas-lamps; they were sold
in the Arcade; and as one of these had burst, it was naturally
supposed that the gasworks would do the same.</p>
<p>The characteristics of old Philadelphia were in those days so
marked, and are, withal, so sweet to the memory, that I cannot
help lingering on them.&nbsp; As Washington Irving says of the
Golden Age of Wouter van Twiller, &ldquo;Happy days when the
harvest moon was twice as large as now, when the shad were all
salmon, and peace was in the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trees grew
abundantly in rows in almost every street&mdash;one before every
house.&nbsp; I had two before mine till 1892, when the Street
Commissioners heartlessly ordained that one must be cut down and
removed, and charged me ten dollars for doing it.&nbsp; It is
needless to say that since Street Commissioners have found this
so profitable, trees have disappeared with sad rapidity.&nbsp;
Then at twilight the <i>pea-ak</i> of the night-hawk could be
heard all over Arasapha, which is the Indian name for the place
where our city stands; there were in Coaquannoc, or the
Schuylkill, abundant gold fish and perch, of which I angled
divers.&nbsp; Yes, there was, and still is, a Fisher Club, which
claims to be the oldest gentleman&rsquo;s club in Anglo-Saxony,
and which has for two centuries brewed for itself a <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;fish-house punch&rdquo; as delicious as that of
London civic banquets.&nbsp; There be no fish in the fair river
now; they have all vanished before the combined forces of
petroleum and the offal of factories and mines, but the
Fish-House Club still has its merry banquets in its ancient home;
for, as the French say, &ldquo;<i>Chacun p&eacute;che &agrave; sa
mani&egrave;re</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In graveyards lone or over
gardens green glittered of summer nights millions of fireflies;
there was the scent of magnolias, roses, pinks, and honeysuckles
by every house; for Philadelphians have always had a passion for
flowers, and there never was a Quaker, much less a Quakeress, who
has not studied botany, and wandered in Bartram&rsquo;s Garden
and culled blue gentians in the early fall, or lilies wild in
Wissahickon&rsquo;s shade.&nbsp; There still remains a very
beautiful relic of this olden time in the old Swedes Church,
which every stranger should visit.&nbsp; It is a quaint structure
of more than two hundred years, and in its large churchyard
(which is not, like Karamsin&rsquo;s graves, &ldquo;deserted and
drear,&rdquo; but charming and garden-like) one can imagine
himself in rural England.</p>
<p>In the spring of the year there was joyous activity on the
Delaware, even in town; for, as the song hath it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;De fishin&rsquo; time hab come at last,<br
/>
De winter all am gone and past;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and there was the casting of immense seines and the catching
of myriads of shad, the typical fish or emblem of the Quaker
Philadelphian, because in the profile outline of the shad people
professed to discern the form according to which the Quaker coat
was cut.&nbsp; With the shad were many herring, and now and then
a desperate giant of a sturgeon, who in his struggles would give
those concerned enough to do.&nbsp; Then the yells of the black
fishermen, the flapping of the horny knife-backed
prey&mdash;often by the flashing of a night-fire&mdash;formed a
picture worthy of Rembrandt.&nbsp; Apropos of these sturgeon, the
fresh caviare or roe (which has been pronounced at St. Petersburg
to surpass the Russian) was always thrown <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>away, as was
often the case with sweetbreads, which were rarely eaten.&nbsp;
But if the caviare or roe was really in those days &ldquo;caviare
to the general&rdquo; multitude, the <i>nose</i> of the fish was
not, it being greatly coveted by us small boys wherewith to make
a ball for &ldquo;shinny,&rdquo; which for some occult reason was
preferred to any other.&nbsp; Old people of my acquaintance could
remember when seals had been killed at Cape May below the city,
and how on one or two occasions a bewildered whale of no small
dimensions had found its way to Burlington, some miles above.</p>
<p>Now and then there would be found in the bay below the city a
tremendous, square-shaped, hideous, unnatural piscatorial
monster, known as a devil-fish, or briefly devil.&nbsp; It was a
legend of my youth that two preachers or ministers of the
Presbyterian faith once went fishing in those waters, and having
cast out a stout line, fastened to the mast, for shark, were
amazed at finding themselves all at once careering through the
waves at terrible speed, being dragged by one of the diabolical
&ldquo;monsters of the roaring deep&rdquo; above mentioned.&nbsp;
Whereupon a friend, who was in the boat, burst out
laughing.&nbsp; And being asked, &ldquo;Wherefore this
unrestrained hilarity?&rdquo; replied, &ldquo;Is it not enough to
make a man laugh to see the Devil running away with two
clergymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very excellent and extensive museum of Matters and
Things in General, founded by an ancient artist named Peale, who
was the head-central charm and delight of all young Philadelphia
in those days, and where, when we had been good all the week, we
were allowed to repair on Saturday afternoons.&nbsp; And here I
may say by the way, that miscellaneous collections of
&ldquo;curiosities,&rdquo; oddities, and relics are far more
attractive to children, and stimulate in them far more interest
and inquisitiveness and desire for general information, than do
the best scientific collections, where everything is ranked and
numbered, and wherein even an Etruscan tiara or a Viking&rsquo;s
sword loses much of its charm when placed simply as a
&ldquo;specimen&rdquo; in a row of others of <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the
kind.&nbsp; I am not arguing here in the least against scientific
or properly arranged arch&aelig;ologic collections, but to
declare the truth that for <i>children</i> museums of the
despised curiosities are far more attractive and infinitely more
useful.</p>
<p>I owe so very much myself to the old Peale&rsquo;s Museum; it
served to stimulate to such a remarkable degree my interest in
antiquities and my singular passion for miscellaneous
information, and it aided me so much in my reading, that I cannot
pass it by without a tribute to its memory.&nbsp; How often have
I paused in its dark galleries in awe before the tremendous
skeleton of the Mammoth&mdash;how small did that of a great
elephant seem beside it&mdash;and recalled the Indian legend of
it recorded by Franklin.&nbsp; And the stuffed monkeys&mdash;one
shaving another&mdash;what exquisite humour, which never palled
upon us!&nbsp; No; <i>that</i> was the museum for us, and the
time will come when there will be such collections made expressly
for the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffed monkey&rdquo; was a common by-word, by the way,
for a conceited fellow.&nbsp; Therefore the <i>Louisville
Journal</i>, speaking of a rival sheet, said: &ldquo;Reader, if
you will go into the Louisville Museum, you will see two stuffed
monkeys reading the <i>Courier</i>.&nbsp; And if you will then go
into the office of the <i>Louisville Courier</i>, you may see two
living stuffed monkeys editing the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
beautiful sallies of this kind which appeared in these two
newspapers for years would make a lively volume.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget one evening alone in that Museum.&nbsp; I
had come with Jacob Pierce&rsquo;s school, and strayed off alone
into some far-away and fascinating nook, forgetful of friends and
time.&nbsp; All the rest had departed homewards, and I sought to
find them.&nbsp; The dark evening shades were casting sombre
tones in the galleries&mdash;I was a very little boy of seven or
eight&mdash;and the stuffed lions and bears and wolves seemed
looming or glooming into mysterious life; the varnished sharks
and hideous shiny crocodiles had a light of awful intelligence in
their eyes; the gigantic anaconda had long <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>awaited me;
the grim hy&aelig;na marked me for his own; even deer and doves
seemed uncanny and goblined.&nbsp; At this long interval of sixty
years, I can recall the details of that walk, and every object
which impressively half-appalled me, and how what had been a
museum had become a chamber of horrors, yet not without a wild
and awful charm.&nbsp; Of course I lost my way in the shades, and
was beginning to speculate on having to pass a night among the
monsters, and how much there would be left for my friends to
mourn over in the morning, when&mdash;Eureka! Thalatta!&mdash;I
beheld the gate of entrance and exit, and made my latter as
joyously as ever did the souls who were played out of Inferno by
the old reprobate of the Roman tale.</p>
<p>Since that adventure I never mentioned it to a living soul
till now, and yet there is not an event of my life so vividly
impressed on my memory.</p>
<p>My father took me very rarely to the theatre; but my Quaker
school-mates had never seen the inside of such places at all, and
therefore listened greedily to what I could tell them of the
sights.&nbsp; One of the wonders of my youth was the seeing the
great elephant Columbus perform in a play called &ldquo;The
Englishman in Siam.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was indeed very curious, and
it is described as such in works on natural history.&nbsp; And I
saw Edwin Forrest (whom I learned to know in later years) in
&ldquo;Metamora,&rdquo; and Fanny Kemble in
&ldquo;Beatrice,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; As for George Boker, he
went, I believe, to every place of amusement whenever he pleased,
and talked familiarly of actors, some of whom he actually knew,
and their lives, in a manner which awoke in me awe and a feeling
as being humble and ignorant indeed.&nbsp; As we grew older,
Boker and I, from reading &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and Scott,
used to sit together for hours improvising legends of chivalry
and marvellous romances.&nbsp; It was in the year when it first
appeared that I read (in the <i>New Monthly</i>) and got quite by
heart the rhyming tale of &ldquo;Sir Rupert the Fearless,&rdquo;
a tale of the Rhine, one of the Ingoldsby legends, by
Barham.&nbsp; I <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>can still repeat a great part of
it.&nbsp; I bore it in mind till in after years it inspired
(allied to Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Wasserm&auml;dchen</i>) my ballad of
<i>De Maiden mit Nodings on</i>, which has, as I now write, been
very recently parodied and pictured by <i>Punch</i>, March 18,
1893.&nbsp; My mother had taught me to get poetry by heart, and
by the time I was ten years of age, I had imbibed, so to speak,
an immense quantity; for, as in opium-eating, those who begin by
effort end by taking in with ease.</p>
<p>There was something else so very characteristic of old
Philadelphia that I will not pass it by.&nbsp; In the fall of the
year the reed-bird, which is quite as good as the ortolan of
Italy, and very much like it (I prefer the reed-bird), came in
large flocks to the marshes and shores of the Delaware and
Schuylkill.&nbsp; Then might be seen a quaint and marvellous
sight of men and boys of all ages and conditions, with firearms
of every faculty and form, followed by dogs of every degree of
badness, in all kinds of boats, among which the <i>bateau</i> of
boards predominated, intermingled with an occasional Maryland
dug-out or poplar canoe.&nbsp; Many, however, crept on foot along
the shore, and this could be seen below the Navy Yard even within
the city limits.&nbsp; Then, as flock after flock of once
bobolinks and now reed-birds rose or fell in flurried flight,
there would be such a banging, cracking, and barking as to
suggest a South American revolution aided by blood-hounds.&nbsp;
That somebody in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> now and then got a
charge of shot in his face, or that angry parties in dispute over
a bird sometimes blazed away at one another and fought
<i>&agrave; l&rsquo;outrance</i> in every way, &ldquo;goes
without saying.&rdquo;&nbsp; Truly they were inspiriting sights,
and kept up the martial valour, aided by frequent firemen&rsquo;s
fights, which made Philadelphians so indomitable in the
Rebellion, when, to the amazement of everybody, our Quaker city
manifested a genius or love for hard fighting never surpassed by
mortals.</p>
<p>There were, of course, some odd episodes among the infantry or
gunners on foot, and one of these was so well <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>described by
my brother Henry in a poem, that I venture to give it place.</p>
<h3>REED-BIRDING.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Two men and a bull-dog ugly,<br />
&nbsp; Two guns and a terrier lame;<br />
They&rsquo;d better stick out in the marsh there,<br />
&nbsp; And set themselves up for game.</p>
<p>But no; I mark by the cocking<br />
&nbsp; Of that red-haired Paddy&rsquo;s eye,<br />
He&rsquo;s been &ldquo;reeding&rdquo; too much for you, sir,<br
/>
&nbsp; Any such game to try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jamie, ye divil, kape dark there,<br />
&nbsp; And hould the big bull-dog in;<br />
There&rsquo;s a bloody big crowd of rade-birds,<br />
&nbsp; That nade a pepperin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ker-rack</i>! goes the single barrel,<br />
&nbsp; <i>Flip-boong</i>! roars the old Queen Anne;<br />
There&rsquo;s a Paddy stretched out in the mud-hole,<br />
&nbsp; A kicked-over, knocked-down man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, Jamie, ye shtupid crature,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure ye&rsquo;re the divil&rsquo;s son;<br />
How many fingers&rsquo; load, thin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did ye putt in this d---d ould gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many fingers, be jabers?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I nivir putt in a wan;<br />
Did ye think I&rsquo;d be afther jammin&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me fingers into a gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, give me the powder, Jamie.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The powder! as sure as I&rsquo;m born,<br />
I put it all into yer musket,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I&rsquo;d nivir a powder-horn!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we all had reed-bird suppers or lunches, eked out perhaps
with terrapins and soft-shell crabs, gumbo,
&ldquo;snapper,&rdquo; or pepper-pot soup, peaches, venison,
bear-meat, <i>salon la saison</i>&mdash;for both bear and deer
roamed wild within fifty or sixty miles&mdash;so that, all things
considered, if Philadelphians, <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and
Baltimoreans did run somewhat over-much to eating up their
intellects&mdash;as Dr. Holmes declares they do&mdash;they had at
least the excuse of terrible temptation, which the men of my
&ldquo;grandfather-land&rdquo; (New England), as he once termed
it in a letter to me, very seldom had at any time.</p>
<p>Once it befell, though a few years later, that one winter
there was a broad fair field of ice just above Fairmount dam,
which is about ten feet high, that about a hundred and fifty men
and maidens were merrily skating by moonlight.&nbsp; I know not
whether Colonel James Page, our great champion skater, was there
cutting High Dutch; but this I know, that all at once, by some
strange rising of the stream, the whole flake of ice and its
occupants went over the dam.&nbsp; Strangely enough, no one was
killed, but very few escaped without injury, and for some time
the surgeons were busy.&nbsp; It would make a strange wild
picture that of the people struggling in the broken floes of ice
among the roaring waters.</p>
<p>And again, during a week on the same spot, some practical
joker amused himself with a magic-lantern by making a spirit form
flit over the fall, against its face, or in the misty air.&nbsp;
The whole city turned out to see it, and great was their
marvelling, and greater the fear among the negroes at the
apparition.</p>
<p>Sears C. Walker, who was an intimate friend, kept a school in
Sansom Street, to which I was transferred.&nbsp; I was only seven
years old at the time, and being the youngest, he made, when I
was introduced, a speech of apology to his pupils.&nbsp; He was a
good kind man, who also, like Jacob, gave us lectures on natural
philosophy and chemistry.&nbsp; There I studied French, and began
to learn to draw, but made little progress, though I worked
hard.&nbsp; I have literally never met in all my life any person
with so little natural gift or aptitude for learning languages or
drawing as I have; and if I have since made an advance in both,
it has been at the cost of such extreme labour as would seem
almost incredible.&nbsp; I was greatly interested in chemistry,
as a child would be, <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and, having heard Mr. Walker say
something about the colouring matter in quartz, resolved on a
great invention which should immortalise my name.&nbsp; My
teacher used to make his own ink by pounding nut-galls in an iron
mortar.&nbsp; I got a piece of coarse rock-crystal, pounded it up
in the same mortar, pouring water on it.&nbsp; Sure enough the
result was a pale ink, which the two elder pupils, who had
maliciously aided and encouraged me, declared was of a very
superior quality.&nbsp; I never shall forget the pride I
felt.&nbsp; I had, first of all scientists, extracted the
colouring matter from quartz!&nbsp; The recipe was at once
written out, with a certificate at the end, signed by my two
witnesses, that they had witnessed the process, and that this was
written with the ink itself!&nbsp; This I gave to Mr. Walker, and
could not understand why he laughed so heartily at it.&nbsp; It
was not till several days after that he explained to me that the
ink was the result of the dregs of the nut-galls which remained
in the mortar.</p>
<p>We had not many books, but what we had I read and reread with
great assiduity.&nbsp; Among them were Cooper&rsquo;s novels,
Campbell&rsquo;s poems, those of Byron, and above all, Washington
Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketch Book,&rdquo; which had great
influence on me, inspiring that intense love for old English
literature and its associations which has ever since been a part
of my very soul.&nbsp; Irving was indeed a wonderful, though not
a <i>startling</i> genius; but he had sympathised himself into
such appreciation of the golden memories and sweet melodies of
the olden time, be it American or English, as no writer now
possesses.&nbsp; In my eighth year I loved deeply his mottoes,
such as that from Syr Grey Steel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that supper for is dight,<br />
He lies full cold I trow this night;<br />
Yestreen to chamber I him led,<br />
This nighte Grey Steel has made his bed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lang&mdash;not Andrew&mdash;has informed us that no copy of
the first black-letter edition of Sir Grey Steel is known to
exist.&nbsp; In after years I found in the back binding of an old
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>folio two pieces of it, each about four inches
square.&nbsp; It has been an odd fatality of mine that whenever a
poet existed in black-letter, I was always sure to peruse him
first in that type, which I always from childhood preferred to
any other.&nbsp; To this day I often dream of being in a
book-shop, turning over endless piles of marvellously quaint
parchment bound books in <i>letres blake</i>, and what is
singular, they are generally works quite unknown to the
world&mdash;first discoveries&mdash;unique!&nbsp; And
then&mdash;oh! then&mdash;how bitter is the waking!</p>
<p>There was in Mr. Walker&rsquo;s school library a book, one
well known as Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural
History.&rdquo;&nbsp; This I read, as usual, thoroughly and
often, and wrote my name at the end, ending with a long snaky
flourish.&nbsp; Years passed by, and I was at the University,
when one evening, dropping in at an auction, I bought for six
cents, or threepence, &ldquo;a blind bundle&rdquo; of six books
tied up with a cord.&nbsp; It was a bargain, for I found in it in
good condition the first American editions of De Quincey&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Opium-Eater,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rejected Addresses,&rdquo;
and the Poems of Coleridge.&nbsp; But what startled me was a
familiar-looking copy of Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural
History,&rdquo; in which at the end was my boyish signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still wider.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1887 I passed some
weeks at a hotel in Venice.&nbsp; A number of Italian naval
officers dined at our <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> every
evening.&nbsp; One of them showed us an intaglio which he had
bought.&nbsp; It represented a hunter on an elephant firing at a
tiger.&nbsp; The owner wished to know something about it.&nbsp;
Baron von Rosenfeld, a chamberlain of the Emperor of Austria,
remarked at once that it was as old as the days of flint-locks,
because smoke was rising from the lock of the gun.&nbsp; I felt
that I knew more about it, but could not at once recall what I
knew, and said that I would explain it the next day.&nbsp; And
going into the past, I remembered that this very scene was the
frontispiece to Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural
History.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think that some gem engraver, possibly in
India, had copied it to order.&nbsp; I can even now recall many
other things in the book, but attribute my retention of <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>so
much which I have read <i>not</i> to a good memory, such as the
mathematician has, which grasps <i>directly</i>, but simply to
frequent reading and mental reviewing or revising.&nbsp; Where
there has been none of this, I forgot everything in a short
time.</p>
<p>My father took in those years <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s</i> and the
<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, and as I read every line of them,
they were to me a vast source of knowledge.&nbsp; I remember an
epigram by &ldquo;Martial in London&rdquo; in the
latter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Craven Street, Strand, four attorneys
find place,<br />
And four dark coal-barges are moored at the base;<br />
Fly, Honesty, fly&mdash;seek some safer retreat,<br />
For there&rsquo;s craft on the river, and craft in the
street.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never pass by Craven Street without recalling this, and so
it has come to pass that by such memories and associations London
in a thousand ways is always reviving my early life in
America.</p>
<p>The <i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i> puzzled me, as did the
Bible, but I read, read, read, <i>toujours</i>.&nbsp; My uncle
Amos lent me the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; though my father
strictly prohibited it.&nbsp; But the zest of the forbidden made
me study it with wondrous love.&nbsp; The reader may laugh, but
it is a fact that having obtained &ldquo;Mother Goose&rsquo;s
Melodies,&rdquo; I devoured them with a strange interest
reflected from Washington Irving.&nbsp; The truth is, that my
taste had been so precociously developed, that I unconsciously
found a <i>literary</i> merit or charm in them as I did in all
fairy-tales, and I remember being most righteously indignant once
when a young bookseller told me that I was getting to be too old
to read such stuff!&nbsp; The truth was, that I was just getting
to be old enough to appreciate it as folk-lore and literature,
which he never did.</p>
<p>The great intellectual influence which acted on me most
powerfully after Irving was an incomplete volume of about 1790,
called &ldquo;The Poetical Epitome.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consisted of
many of Percy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Relics&rdquo; with selections of
ballads, poems, and <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>epigrams of many eminent
writers.&nbsp; I found it a few years after at a boarding-school,
where I continually read it as before.</p>
<p>As I was backward in my studies, my parents, very
injudiciously so far as learning was concerned, removed me from
Mr. Walker&rsquo;s school, and put me under the care of T.
Bronson Alcott, who had just come to Philadelphia.&nbsp; This was
indeed going from the frying-pan into the very fire, so far as
curing idleness and desultory habits and a tendency to romance
and wild speculation was concerned.&nbsp; For Mr. Alcott was the
most eccentric man who ever took it on himself to train and form
the youthful mind.&nbsp; He did not really teach any practical
study; there was indeed some pretence at geography and
arithmetic, but these we were allowed to neglect at our own sweet
will.&nbsp; His forte was &ldquo;moral influence&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sympathetic intellectual communion&rdquo; by talking; and
oh, heaven! what a talker he was!&nbsp; He was then an incipient
Transcendentalist, and he did not fail to discover in me the
seeds of the same plant.&nbsp; He declared that I had a
marvellous imagination, and encouraged my passion for reading
anything and everything to the very utmost.&nbsp; It is a fact
that at nine years of age his disquisitions on and readings from
Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faerie Queen&rdquo; actually induced me to
read the entire work, of which he was very proud, reminding me of
it in 1881, when I went to Harvard to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa
poem.&nbsp; He also read thoroughly into us the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; Quarles&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Emblems,&rdquo; Northcote&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fables,&rdquo;
much Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Milton, all of which
sunk into my very soul, educating me indeed &ldquo;ideally&rdquo;
as no boy perhaps in Philadelphia had ever been educated, at the
utter cost of all real &ldquo;education.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a
great pity, and pity &rsquo;tis &rsquo;tis true.&nbsp; The word
<i>ideal</i> was ever in his mouth.&nbsp; All of the new
theories, speculations, or fads which were beginning to be
ventilated among the Unitarian liberal clergy found ready welcome
in his dreamy brain, and he retailed them all to his pupils,
among whom I was certainly the only one who <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>took them in
and seriously thought them over.&nbsp; Yet I cannot say that I
<i>really</i> liked the man himself.&nbsp; He was not to me
exactly sympathetic-human.&nbsp; Such training as his would
develop in any boy certain weaknesses&mdash;and I had
mine&mdash;which were very repulsive to my father, who carried
plain common-sense to extremes, and sometimes into its opposite
of unconscious eccentricity, though there was no word which he so
much hated.</p>
<p>Bulwer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Days of Pompeii,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Disowned,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pilgrims of the Rhine&rdquo; made a
deep and lasting impression on me.&nbsp; I little thought then
that I should in after years be the guest of the author in his
home, and see the skull of Arbaces.&nbsp; Oh, that by some magic
power every author could be made to feel <i>all</i> the
influence, all the charm, which his art exerts on his readers,
and especially the young.&nbsp; Sometimes, now and then, by
golden chance, a writer of books does realise this, and then
feels that he has lived to some purpose.&nbsp; Once it happened
to me to find a man, an owner of palaces and millions, who had
every facility for becoming familiar with far greater minds and
books than mine, who had for years collected with care and read
everything which I had ever written.&nbsp; He actually knew more
about my books than I did.&nbsp; I was startled at the discovery
as at a miracle.&nbsp; And if the reader knew <i>what</i> a
<i>m&eacute;lange</i> I have written, he would not wonder at
it.</p>
<p>It is very probable that no man living appreciates the vast
degree to which any book whatever which aims at a little more
than merely entertaining, and appeals at all to thought,
influences the world, and how many readers it gets.&nbsp; There
are books, of which a thousand copies were never sold, which have
permeated society and been the argument of national
revolutions.&nbsp; Such a book was the &ldquo;Political
Economy&rdquo; of H. C. Carey, of which I possess the very last
copy of the first, and I believe the only, edition.&nbsp; And
there are novels which have gone to the three hundred thousand,
of whose authors it may be said that</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>&ldquo;Over the barren desert of
their brains<br />
There never strayed the starved camel of an idea,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and whose works vanish like wind.</p>
<p>What is very remarkable is the manner in which even the great
majority of readers confuse these two classes, and believe that
mere popular success is correlative with genius and desert.&nbsp;
A great cause of this really vulgar error is the growing
conviction that artistic skill alone determines merit in
literature, and that intellect, as the French, beginning mildly
with Voltaire and ending violently with Sainte-Beuve, assert is
of far less importance than style.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Le style</i>,
<i>c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;esprit du si&egrave;cle</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Apropos of which I remarked that in the warlike Middle Age in
France the motto might have been &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;homme
c&rsquo;est le</i> <span class="smcap">steel</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then came the age of wigs, when the cry was,
&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;homme c&rsquo;est le</i> <span
class="smcap">style</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now we are in the
swindling and bogus-company-promoting age, when it might be
proclaimed that &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;homme c&rsquo;est le</i> <span
class="smcap">steal</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another book which I read through and through in
early childhood to great profit.&nbsp; This was Cottle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; an epic of some merit, but chiefly in this,
that it sets forth tolerably clearly the old Norse life and
religion.&nbsp; George Boker owned and gave me some time after a
book entitled &ldquo;Five Norse Poems,&rdquo; in the original,
and translated.&nbsp; This with Grey&rsquo;s poems, which latter
I possessed, laid the basis for a deep interest in after years in
Northern antiquities; they were soon followed by Mallett; and if
I have since read many sagas in Icelandic and studied with
keenest interest the museums of the North, the first incentive
thereto came from my boyish reading.&nbsp; When I was sixteen I
executed a poetic version of the &ldquo;Death Song of Regner
Lodbrog,&rdquo; which, though it was never published, I think was
at least as good as any translation which I have since executed,
&ldquo;however that may be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I very seriously
connected this Norse spirit with my grandfather and his stern
uncles and progenitors, who had fought in Canada and in the icy
winters of New England; grim men they were all; and I daresay
that I was <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>quite right.&nbsp; It always seems to
me that among these alternately fighting and farming Icelanders I
am among my Leland relatives; and I even once found Uncle Seth in
his red waistcoat in the Burnt Njals saga to the life.&nbsp;
There was a paragraph, as I write, recently circulating in the
newspapers, in which I was compared in appearance to an old grey
Viking, and it gave me a strange uncanny thrill, as if the writer
of it were a wizard who had revealed a buried secret.</p>
<p>My parents, on coming to Philadelphia, had at first attended
the Episcopal church, but finding that most of their New England
friends held to the Rev. W. H. (now Dr.) Furness, an Unitarian,
they took a pew in his chapel.&nbsp; After fifteen years they
returned to the Episcopal faith, but allowed me to keep the pew
to myself for one or two years, till I went to college.&nbsp; In
Dr. Furness&rsquo;s chapel I often heard Channing and all the
famous Unitarian divines of the time preach, and very often saw
Miss Harriet Martineau, Dr. Combe, the phrenologist, and many
other distinguished persons.&nbsp; In other places at different
times I met Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, to whom I was introduced,
Daniel Webster, to whom I reverently bowed, receiving in return a
gracious acknowledgment, Peter Duponceau, Morton, Stephen Girard,
Joseph Buonaparte, the two authors of the &ldquo;Jack Downing
Letters&rdquo;; and I once heard David Crockett make a
speech.&nbsp; Apropos of Joseph Buonaparte, I can remember to
have heard my wife&rsquo;s mother, the late Mrs. Rodney Fisher,
tell how when a little girl, and while at his residence at
Bordentown, she had run a race with the old ex-king of
Spain.&nbsp; A very intimate friend in our family was Professor
John Frost, the manufacturer of literally innumerable works of
every description.&nbsp; He had many thousands of woodcut blocks,
and when he received an order&mdash;as, for example, a history of
any country, or of the world, or of a religion, or a school
geography, or book of travel or adventure, or a biography, or
anything else that the heart of man could conceive&mdash;he set
his scribes to write, scissors and paste, and lo! the book was
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>made forthwith, he aiding and revising it.&nbsp; What
was most remarkable was that many of these <i>pi&egrave;ces de
manufacture</i> were rather clever, and very well answered the
demand, for their sale was enormous.&nbsp; He had when young been
in the West Indies, and written a clever novelette entitled
&ldquo;Ramon, the Rover of Cuba.&rdquo;&nbsp; Personally he was
very handsome, refined, and intelligent; a man meant by Nature
for higher literary work than mere book-making.</p>
<p>Miss Eliza Leslie, the writer of the best series of sketches
of American domestic life of her day, was a very intimate friend
of my mother, and a constant visitor at our house.&nbsp; She was
a sister of Leslie, the great artist, and had been in her early
life much in England.&nbsp; I was a great favourite with her, and
owed much to her always entertaining and very instructive
conversation, which was full of reminiscences of distinguished
people and remarkable events.&nbsp; I may say with great truth
that I really profited as much by mere hearing as many boys would
have done by knowing the originals, so deep was the interest
which I felt in all that I heard, and so eager my desire to learn
to know the world.</p>
<p>Then I was removed, and with good cause, from Mr.
Alcott&rsquo;s school, for he had become so very
&ldquo;ideal&rdquo; or eccentric in his teaching and odd methods
of punishment by tormenting without ever whipping, that people
could not endure his purely intellectual system.&nbsp; So for one
winter, as my health was bad and I was frequently ill, for a long
time I was allowed to do nothing but attend a writing-school kept
by a Mr. Rand.&nbsp; At the end of the season, he sadly admitted
that I still wrote badly; I think he pronounced me the worst and
most incurable case of bad writing which he had ever
attended.&nbsp; In 1849 Judge (then Mr.) Cadwallader, with whom I
was studying law, said that he admired my engrossing hand more
than any he had ever seen except one.&nbsp; As hands go round the
clock, our hands do change.</p>
<p>I was to go the next summer to New England with my younger
brother, Henry Perry Leland, to be placed in the <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>celebrated boarding-school of Mr. Charles W. Greene, at
Jamaica Plains, five miles from Boston; which was done, and with
this I enter on a new phase of life, of which I have very vivid
reminiscences.&nbsp; Let me state that we first went to Dedham
and stayed some weeks.&nbsp; There I found living with his
father, an interesting boy of my own age, named William Joshua
Barney, a grandson of the celebrated Commodore Barney, anent whom
was written the song, &ldquo;Barney, leave the girls
alone,&rdquo; apropos of his having been allowed to kiss Marie
Antoinette and all her maids of honour.&nbsp; William had already
been at Mr. Greene&rsquo;s school, and we soon became
intimate.</p>
<p>During this time my father hired a chaise; I borrowed
William&rsquo;s shot-gun, and we went together on a delightful
tour to visit all our relations in Holliston, Milford, and
elsewhere.&nbsp; At one time we stopped to slay an immense black
snake; at another to shoot wild pigeons, and &ldquo;so on
about&rdquo; to Providence and many places.&nbsp; From cousins
who lived in old farmhouses in wild and remote places I received
Indian arrow-heads and a stone tomahawk, and other rustic
curiosities dear to my heart.&nbsp; At the Fremont House in
Boston my father showed me one day at dinner several foreign
gentlemen of different nations belonging to different
Legations.&nbsp; In Rhode Island I found by a stream several
large pot-holes in rocks of which I had read, and explained to my
father (gravely as usual) how they were made by eddies of water
and gravel-stones.&nbsp; One day my father in Boston took me to
see a marvellous white shell from China, valued at one hundred
pounds.&nbsp; What was the amazement of all present to hear me
give its correct Latin name, and relate a touching tale of a
sailor who, finding such a shell when shipwrecked on a desert
island, took it home with him, &ldquo;and was thereby raised (as
I told them) from poverty to affluence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which tale I
had read the week before in a children&rsquo;s magazine, and, as
usual, reflected deeply on it, resolving to keep my eye on all
shells in future, in the hope of something turning up.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>I was <i>not</i>, however, a little prig who bored
people with my reading, for I have heard old folk say that there
was a quaint <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and droll seriousness,
and total unconsciousness of superior information in my manner,
which made these outpourings of mine very amusing.&nbsp; I think
I was a kind of little Paul Dombey, unconsciously odd, and
perhaps innocently Quaker-like.&nbsp; I could never understand
why Aunt Nancy, and many more, seemed to be so much amused at
serious and learned examples and questions which I laid down to
them.&nbsp; For though they did not &ldquo;smile outright,&rdquo;
I had learned to penetrate the New England ironical glance and
satirical intonation.&nbsp; My mother said that, when younger, I,
having had a difficulty of some kind with certain street-boys,
came into the house with my eyes filled with tears, and said,
&ldquo;I told them that they were evil-minded, but they laughed
me to scorn.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion, when some vagabond
street-boys asked me to play with them, I gravely declined, on
the ground that I must &ldquo;Shun bad company&rdquo;&mdash;this
phrase being the title of a tract which I had read, and the boys
corresponding in appearance to a picture of sundry young
ragamuffins on its title-page.</p>
<p>My portrait had been admirably painted in Philadelphia by Mrs.
Darley, the daughter of Sully, who, I believe, put the finishing
touches to it.&nbsp; When Mr. Walker saw it, he remarked that it
looked exactly as if Charley were just about to tell one of his
stories.&nbsp; At the time I was reading for the first time
&ldquo;The Child&rsquo;s Own Book,&rdquo; an admirable large
collection of fairy-tales and strange adventures, which kept me
in fairy-land many a time while I lay confined to bed for weeks
with pleurisies and a great variety of afflictions, for in this
respect I suffered far more than most children.</p>
<h3><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>AT SCHOOL IN NEW ENGLAND.</h3>
<p>Mr. Charles W. Greene was a portly, ruddy, elderly Boston
gentleman of good family, who had been in early life attached in
some diplomatic capacity to a Legation, and had visited
Constantinople.&nbsp; I think that he had met with reverses, but
having some capital, had been established by his many friends as
a schoolmaster.&nbsp; He was really a fine old gentleman, with a
library full of old books, and had Madeira in quaint little old
bottles, on which, stamped in the glass, one could read <span
class="smcap">Greene</span> 1735.&nbsp; He had a dear little
wife, and both were as kind to the boys as possible.&nbsp; Once,
and once only, when I had really been very naughty, did he punish
me.&nbsp; He took me solemnly into the library (oh, what blessed
beautiful reading I often had there!), and, after a solemn
speech, and almost with tears in his eyes, gave me three blows
with a folded newspaper!&nbsp; That was enough.&nbsp; If I had
been flayed with a rope&rsquo;s end, it would not have had a
greater moral effect than it did.</p>
<p>Everything was very English and old-fashioned about the
place.&nbsp; The house was said in 1835 to be a hundred and fifty
years old, having been one of the aristocratic Colonial
manors.&nbsp; One building after another had been added to it,
and the immense elms which grew about testified to its age.&nbsp;
The discipline or training was eminently adapted to make young
gentlemen of us all.&nbsp; There was almost no immorality among
the boys, and no fighting whatever.&nbsp; The punishments were
bad marks, and for every mark a boy was obliged to go to bed an
hour earlier than the others.&nbsp; Extreme cases of wickedness
were punished by sending boys to bed in the daytime.&nbsp; When
two were in a room, and thus confined, they used to relieve the
monotony of their imprisonment by fighting with pillows.&nbsp;
Those who had bad marks were also confined within certain
bounds.&nbsp; Good boys, or those especially favoured, were
allowed to chop kindling wood, or do other light work, for which
they were paid three cents per hour.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>The boy who was first down in the morning had an apple
given to him.&nbsp; This apple was greatly despised by the bolder
spirits, who taunted those who arose promptly with a desire to
obtain it.</p>
<p>Candour compels me to admit that, as a teacher of learning,
Mr. Greene was not pre-eminent.&nbsp; He had two schoolrooms, and
employed for each as good a teacher as he could hire.&nbsp; But
we were not at all thoroughly well taught, although we were kept
longer in the schoolroom than was really good for us; for in
summer we had an hour&rsquo;s study before breakfast, then from
nine till twelve, and again from two to five.&nbsp; In winter we
had, instead of the early lesson, an hour in the evening.&nbsp;
Something was wanting in the system, and I believe that after a
year and a half I knew no more, as regards studies, than I did
when I first entered.</p>
<p>When a boy&rsquo;s birthday came, he was allowed to have some
special dainty for us all.&nbsp; I was very much disgusted with
the Boston boys when they selected pork and beans, which I
loathed.&nbsp; Some would choose plum-pudding, others
apple-pies.&nbsp; There were always two or three dishes for
breakfast, as, for instance, fried potatoes and butter, or cold
meat, or pan-dowdy&mdash;a kind of coarse and broken up
apple-pie&mdash;with the tea and bread and coffee, but we could
only eat of one.&nbsp; There was rather too much petty
infant-schoolery in all this, but we got on very well.&nbsp;
Pepper and mustard were forbidden, but I always had a great
natural craving for these, and when I asked for them, Mr. Greene
would shake his head, but always ended by handing them to
me.&nbsp; He was a <i>bon vivant</i> himself, and sympathised
with me.&nbsp; There were one or two books also of a rather
peppery or spicy nature in his library, such as a collection of
rollicking London songs, at which he likewise shook his head when
I asked for them&mdash;but I got them.&nbsp; There I read for the
first time all of Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels, and the Percy
Ballads, and some of Marryatt&rsquo;s romances, and Hood&rsquo;s
Annual, and Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s first poems.</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>There was in Mr. Greene&rsquo;s library a very curious
and now rare work in three volumes, published in Boston at some
time in the twenties, called &ldquo;The Marvellous
Depository.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consisted of old legends of Boston,
such as the story of &ldquo;Peter Rugg,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom Walker
and the Devil,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Golden Tooth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Captain Kidd,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Witch Flymaker,&rdquo; and
an admirable collection of unearthly German tales, such as
&ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Elixir,&rdquo; by Hoffmann (abridged),
&ldquo;Jacob the Bowl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rubezahl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Der
Freyschutz,&rdquo; and many more, but all of the unearthly
blood-curdling kind.&nbsp; Singly, they were appalling enough to
any one in those days when the supernatural still thrilled the
strongest minds, but taken altogether for steady reading, the
book was a perfect Sabbat of deviltry and dramatic horrors.&nbsp;
The tales were well told, or translated in very simple but
vigorous English, and I pored over the collection and got it by
heart, and borrowed it, and took it to Dedham in the holidays,
and into the woods, where I read it in sunshine or twilight shade
by the rippling river, under wild rocks, and so steeped my soul
in the supernatural, that I seemed to live a double life.&nbsp;
As was natural, my schoolmates read and liked such tales, but
they sunk into my very soul, and took root, and grew up into a
great overshadowing forest, while with others they were only as
dwarf bushes, if they grew at all.&nbsp; All of this&mdash;though
I did not know it&mdash;was unconsciously educating my bewitched
mind to a deep and very precocious passion for medi&aelig;val and
black-letter literature and occult philosophy, which was destined
to manifest itself within a few years.</p>
<p>There was another book which greatly influenced my mind and
life.&nbsp; I have forgotten the title, but it was a very
remarkable collection of curiosities, such as accounts of a
family of seven children who had every one some strange
peculiarity, dwarfs and giants, and mysteriously-gifted mortals,
and all kinds of odd beings and inventions.&nbsp; I obtained in a
very mysterious way; for one day I found it in my desk, a blessed
gift indeed from some unknown friend who <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>had rightly
judged of my tastes.&nbsp; This work I literally lived upon for a
long time.&nbsp; Once a lady friend of my mother&rsquo;s came in
winter and took me a-sleighing, but I had my dear book under my
jacket, and contrived now and then to re-read some anecdote in
it.&nbsp; In after years I found a copy of it in the Mercantile
Library, Philadelphia, but I have never seen it elsewhere. <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; I had at Mr. Alcott&rsquo;s
carefully studied all the Percy Anecdotes, and could repeat most
of them when recalled by some association; also Goldsmith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Animated Nature,&rdquo; the perusal of which latter work
was to me as the waving of a forest and the sighing of deep
waters.&nbsp; Then, too, I had read&mdash;in fact I
owned&mdash;the famous Peter Parley books, which gave me, as they
have to thousands of boys, a desire to travel and see the
world.&nbsp; I marvelled greatly at finding that Peter Parley
himself, or Mr. S. G. Goodrich, had a beautiful country-house
very near our school, and his son Frank, who was a very pleasant
and wonderfully polite and sunshiny boy, sat by me in
school.&nbsp; Frank Goodrich in after life wrote a novel entitled
&ldquo;Flirtation and its Consequences,&rdquo; of which my
brother said, &ldquo;What are its consequences, Frank; good rich
husbands?&nbsp; By no means.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can remember being
invited to a perfectly heavenly garden-party at the
Goodrichs&rsquo;, and evening visits there with my mother.&nbsp;
And I may note by the way, that Frank himself lived abroad in
after years; that his father became the American Consul <!-- page
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>in
Paris, and that in 1848 he introduced to the <i>Gouvernement
Provisoire</i> the American delegation, of which I was one, and
how we were caricatured in the <i>Charivari</i>, in which
caricature I was specially depicted, the likeness being at once
recognised by everybody, and how I knew nothing of it all till I
was told about it by the beautiful Miss Goodrich, Frank&rsquo;s
younger sister, on a Staten Island steamboat, many, many years
after.&nbsp; And as a postscript I may add, that it is literally
true that before I was quite twenty-three years of age I had been
twice caricatured or pictorially jested on in the Munich
<i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i> and twice in the Paris
<i>Charivari</i>, which may show that I was to a certain degree
about town in those days, as I indeed was.&nbsp; While I am about
it, I may as well tell the Munich tale.&nbsp; There was a pretty
governess, a great friend of mine, who had charge of two
children.&nbsp; Meeting her one day in the park, at a sign from
me she pressed the children&rsquo;s hats down over their eyes
with &ldquo;Kinder, setzt eure H&uuml;te fester auf!&rdquo; and
in that blessed instant cast up her beautiful lips and was
kissed.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether we were overseen;
certain it is that in the next number of the <i>Fliegende
Bl&auml;tter</i> the scene was well depicted, with the
words.&nbsp; The other instance was this.&nbsp; One evening I met
in a <i>Bierhalle</i> a sergeant of police with whom I
fraternised.&nbsp; I remember that he could talk modern Greek,
having learned it in Greece.&nbsp; This was very <i>infra
dig.</i> indeed for a student, and one of my comrades said to me
that, as I was a foreigner, I was probably not aware of what a
fault I had committed, but that in future I must not be seen
talking to a soldier.&nbsp; To which I, with a terrible wink,
replied, &ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word; that soldier is
<i>lieutenant of police in my ward</i>, and I have squared it
with him all right, so that if there should be a
<i>Bierkrawall</i> (a drunken row) in our quarter he will let me
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, which appeared as a grand flight of genial
genius to a German, speedily went through all the students&rsquo;
<i>kneipe</i>, and soon appeared, very well illustrated, in the
&ldquo;<i>F. B</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were allowed sixpence a week spending-money at Mr. <!--
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Greene&rsquo;s, two cents, or a penny, being deducted
for a bad mark.&nbsp; Sometimes I actually got a full
week&rsquo;s income; once I let it run on up to 25 cents, but
this was forbidden, it not being considered advisable that the
boys should accumulate fortunes.&nbsp; A great deal of my money
went for cheap comic literature, which I carefully
preserved.&nbsp; In those days there were Crockett&rsquo;s
almanacs (now a great fund of folk-lore), and negro songs and
stories were beginning to be popular.&nbsp; It is very commonly
asserted that the first regular negro minstrel troupe appeared in
1842.&nbsp; This is quite an error.&nbsp; While I was at Mr.
Greene&rsquo;s, in 1835, there came to Dedham a circus with as
regularly-appointed a negro minstrel troupe of a dozen as I ever
saw.&nbsp; I often beheld the pictures of them on the bill.&nbsp;
Nor do I think that this was any novelty even then.&nbsp; The
Crockett almanacs greatly stimulated my sense of American humour
(they do indeed form collectively a very characteristic work),
and this, with some similar reading, awoke in me a passion for
wild Western life and frontier experiences, which was fully and
strangely gratified in after years, but which would certainly
have never happened had it not been for this boyish reading.</p>
<p>For I beg the reader to observe that it is a very
deeply-seated characteristic that whatever once takes root in my
mind invariably grows.&nbsp; This comes from the great degree to
which I have always gone over, reviewed, and <i>reflected on</i>,
or nursed everything which ever once really interested me.&nbsp;
And as I have thus far written, and shall probably conclude this
work without referring to a note, the reader will have ample
opportunity of observing how very strangely in all cases the
phases of my life were predetermined long before by the literary
education which I gave myself, aided very much by hereditary or
other causes quite beyond my control.&nbsp; Now, as the object of
a <i>Life</i> is to understand every cause which created it, and
as mine was to a very unusual degree created by reading and
<i>reflecting</i>, even in infancy, I beg the reader not to be
impatient with me for describing so much in detail the <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>books
which made my mind at different times.&nbsp; That is, I pray this
much allowance and sympathy from possible readers and critics,
that they will kindly not regard me as vain or thinking over-much
of, or too much over, myself.&nbsp; For to get oneself forth as
one really is requires deep investigation into <i>every</i>
cause, and the depicting all early characteristics, and the man
never lived who ever did this truly and accurately without much
egoism, or what the ill-disposed may treat as such.&nbsp; And I
promise the possible reader that when this subjective analysis
shall be fairly disposed of, there will be no lack of mere
incident or event of objective nature and more general
interest.</p>
<p>My first winter at Jamaica Plains was the terrible one of
1835, during which I myself saw the thermometer at 50 degrees
Fahrenheit below zero, and there was a snow-bank in the
play-ground from October till May.&nbsp; The greatest care
possible was taken of us boys to keep us warm and well, but we
still suffered very much from chilblains.&nbsp; Water thrown into
the air froze while falling.&nbsp; Still there were some happy
lights and few shadows in it all.&nbsp; The boys skated or slid
on beautiful Jamaica Pond, which was near the school.&nbsp; There
was a general giving of sleds to us all; mine broke to pieces at
once.&nbsp; I never had luck with any plaything, never played
ball or marbles, and hardly ever had even a top.&nbsp; Nor did I
ever have much to do with any games, or even learn in later years
to play cards, which was all a great pity.&nbsp; Sports should be
as carefully looked to in early education as book-learning.&nbsp;
I had also a pair of dear gazelle-skates given to me with the
rest, but they also broke up on first trial, and I have never
owned any since.&nbsp; Destiny was always against me in such
matters.</p>
<p>The boys built two large snow-houses, roofed in or arched over
with hard snow.&nbsp; One was ingeniously and appropriately like
an Eskimo hut, with a rather long winding passage leading into
it.&nbsp; Of these I wrote in the spring, when the sun had begun
to act, &ldquo;one is almost annihilated, and of the <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>other
not a <i>vestage</i> remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; I found the letter by
chance many years later.</p>
<p>There lived in Boston some friends of my mother&rsquo;s named
Gay.&nbsp; In the family was an old lady over eighty, who was a
wonderfully lively spirited person.&nbsp; She still sang, as I
thought, very beautifully, to the lute, old songs such as
&ldquo;The merry days of good Queen Bess,&rdquo; and remembered
the old Colonial time as if it were of yesterday.&nbsp; One day
Mr. Gay came out and took me to his house, where I remained from
Saturday until Monday; during which time I found among the books,
and very nearly read through, all the poems of Peter Pindar or
Doctor Wolcott.&nbsp; Precious reading it was for a boy of
eleven, yet I enjoyed it immensely.&nbsp; While there, I found in
the earth in the garden an oval, dark-green porphyry pebble,
which I, moved by a strange feeling, preserved for many years as
an amulet.&nbsp; It is very curious that exactly such pebbles are
found as fetishes all over the world, and the famous conjuring
stone of the Voodoos, which I possess, is only an ordinary black
flint pebble of the same shape.&nbsp; Negroes have travelled a
thousand miles to hold it in their hands and make a wish, which,
if uttered with <i>faith</i>, is always granted.&nbsp; Its
possession alone entitles any one to the first rank as master in
the mysteries of Voodoo sorcery.&nbsp; Truly I began early in the
business!&nbsp; I may here say that since I owned the Voodoo
stone it has been held in several very famous and a few very
beautiful hands.</p>
<p>While I was at Mr. Greene&rsquo;s I wrote my first poem.&nbsp;
I certainly exhibited no great precocity of lyrical genius in it,
but the reader must remember that I was only a foolish little boy
of ten or eleven at the time, and that I showed it to no
one.&nbsp; It was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a long-bearded Sultan, an infidel
Turk,<br />
Who ne&rsquo;er in his life had done any work,<br />
Rode along to the bath, he saw Hassan the black,<br />
With two monstrous water-skins high on his back.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ho, Hassan, thou afreet! thou infidel
dog!<br />
Thou son of a Jewess and eater of hog!<br />
This instant, this second, put down thy skin jugs,<br />
And for my sovereign pleasure remove both the plugs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The negro obeyed him, put both on the ground,<br />
And opened the skins and the water flew round;<br />
The Sultan looked on till he laugh&egrave;d his fill;<br />
Then went on to the bath, feeling heated and ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When arrived at the bath, &lsquo;Is all ready?&rsquo;
he cries.<br />
&lsquo;Indeed it is not, sire,&rsquo; the bath-man replies;<br />
&lsquo;For to fetch the bath-water black Hassan has gone,<br />
And your highness can&rsquo;t have it till he shall
return.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In after years my friend, Professor E. H. Palmer, translated
this into Arabic, and promised me that it should be sung in the
East.&nbsp; It is not much of a poem, even for a boy, but there
is one touch true to life in it&mdash;which is the
<i>cursing</i>.&nbsp; This must have come to me by revelation;
and in after years in Cairo I never heard a native address
another as &ldquo;<i>Afrit</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Ya-hinzeer</i>&mdash;<i>wa Yahud</i>&mdash;<i>yin uldeen
ak</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;curse your religion!&rdquo;&mdash;but
I thought how marvellous it was that I, even in my infancy, had
divined so well how they did it!&nbsp; However, now I come to
think of it, I had the year before read Morier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Haji-Baba&rdquo; with great admiration, and I doubt not
that it was the influence of that remarkable book which produced
this beautiful result.&nbsp; In after years I met with a lady who
was a daughter of Morier.&nbsp; Apropos of the <i>book</i>, it
reminds me that I specially recall my <i>reviewing</i> it
mentally many times.</p>
<p>I have reviewed my early life in quiet, old-fashioned, shaded
Philadelphia and in rural New England so continually and
carefully all the time ever since it passed that I am sure its
minutest detail on any day would now be accurately recalled at
the least suggestion.&nbsp; As I shall almost certainly write
this whole work without referring to a note or journal or other
document, it will be seen that I remember the past pretty
well.&nbsp; What is most remarkable in it all, if I <i>can</i>
make myself intelligible, is that what between the deep and
indelible <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>impression made on my mind by
<i>books</i>, and that of scenery and characters now passed
away&mdash;the two being connected&mdash;it all seems to me now
to be as it were vividly depicted, coloured, or <i>written</i> in
my mind, like pages in an illuminated or illustrated
romance.&nbsp; As some one has said that dreams are novels which
we read when asleep, so bygone memories, when continually revived
and associated with the subtle and delicate influences of
<i>reading</i>, really become fixed literature to us, glide into
it, and are virtually turned to copy, which only awaits
type.&nbsp; Thus a <i>scene</i> to one highly cultivated in art
is really a picture, to a degree which few actually realise,
though they may fancy they do, because to actually master this
harmony requires so many years of study and thought that I very
rarely meet with perfect instances of it.&nbsp; De Quincey and
Coleridge are two of the best illustrations whom I can recall,
while certain analytical character-sifters in modern novels seem
the farthest remote from such genial naturalness.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year my brother returned to
Philadelphia.&nbsp; I passed the summer at Dr. Stimson&rsquo;s,
in Dedham, wandering about in the woods with my bow, fishing in
the river, reading always whatever fate or a small circulating
library provided&mdash;I remember that &ldquo;The Devil on Two
Sticks&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Narrative of Captain Boyle&rdquo;
were in it&mdash;and carving spoons and serpents from wood, which
was a premonition of my later work in this line, and of my
&ldquo;Manual of Wood-Carving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time something took place which deeply impressed
me.&nbsp; This was the two hundredth anniversary of the building
of the town of Dedham, which was celebrated with very great
splendour: speeches, tents with pine-boughs, music-booths,
ginger-beer, side-shows&mdash;in short, all the pomp and
circumstance of a country fair allied to historic glory.&nbsp; I
had made one or two rather fast and, I fear me, not
over-reputable acquaintances of my own age, with whom I enjoyed
the festival to the utmost.&nbsp; Then I returned to school, and
autumn <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>came, and then winter.&nbsp; At this
time I felt fearfully lonely.&nbsp; I yearned for my mother with
a longing beyond words, and was altogether home-sick.</p>
<p>I was seated one Saturday afternoon, busily working in the
drawing-class under a little old Englishman named Dr. Hunt, when
there came the startling news that a gentleman had come to take
me home!&nbsp; I could hardly believe my senses.&nbsp; I went
down, and was presented to a man of about thirty, of extremely
pleasant and attractive appearance, who told me that his name was
Carlisle, that he was a friend of my father&rsquo;s, and that I
was at once to return with him to Philadelphia.&nbsp; I wonder
that I did not faint with joy.&nbsp; Mr. Carlisle was a man of
very remarkable intelligence, kindness, and refinement.&nbsp;
Nearly sixty years have passed since then, and yet the memory of
the delightful impression which he made on me is as fresh as
ever.&nbsp; My trunk was soon packed; we were whirled away to
Boston, and went to a hotel, he treating me altogether like a
young gentleman and an equal.</p>
<p>It had been the dream and hope and wild desire of my life to
go to the Lion Theatre in Boston, where circus was combined with
roaring maritime melodramas, of which I had heard heavenly
accounts from a few of my schoolmates.&nbsp; And Mr. Carlisle
took me there that evening, and I saw &ldquo;Hyder
Ali.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never, never in my life before did I dream that
dramatic art, poetry, and <i>mimesis</i> could attain to such
ideal splendour.&nbsp; And then a sailor came on the stage and
sang &ldquo;Harry Bluff,&rdquo; and when he came to the last
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And he died like a true Yankee sailor at
last,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>amid thundering hurrahs, it seemed to me that romance could go
no farther.&nbsp; I do not think that Mr. Carlisle had any
knowledge of boys, certainly not of such a boy as I was, but I am
sure that he must have been amply repaid for his kindness to me
in my delight.&nbsp; And there were acrobatic performances, <!--
page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>such as I had never seen in my life, and we returned to
the hotel and a grand supper, and I was in heaven.</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Carlisle put into my hand, with great
delicacy, such a sum as I had never before possessed, telling me
that I &ldquo;would need it for travelling expenses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All the while he drew me out on literature.&nbsp; On the Long
Island Sound steamer he bade me notice a young gentleman (whom I
was destined to know in after years), a man with curly hair and
very foppish air, accompanied by a page &ldquo;in an eruption of
buttons,&rdquo; and told me that it was N. P. Willis.&nbsp; And
so revelling in romance and travel, with mince-pie and turkey for
my daily food, my pocket stuffed with money, in the most refined
and elegant literary society (at least it was there on deck), I
came to Philadelphia.&nbsp; I may here say that the memory of Mr.
Carlisle has made me through all my life kinder to boys than I
might otherwise have been; and if, as a teacher, I have been
popular among them, it was to a great degree due to his
influence.&nbsp; For, as will appear in many passages in this
book, I have to a strange degree the habit of thinking over
marked past experiences, and drawing from them precedents by
which to guide my conduct; hence it has often happened that a
single incident has shown itself in hundreds of others, as a star
is reflected in countless pools.</p>

or B&ouml;hme&mdash;Stonington&mdash;Captain Nat Palmer and

<p>How happy I was again to see my mother and father and
Henry!&nbsp; And then came other joys.&nbsp; My father had taken
a very nice house in Walnut Street, in the best quarter of the
city, below Thirteenth Street, and this was a source of pleasure,
as was also a barrel of apples in the cellar, to which I had free
access.&nbsp; They had been doled out to us very sparingly at
school, and I never shall forget the delight with which I one day
in December at Jamaica Plain discovered a frozen apple on a
tree!&nbsp; Then there was the charm of being in a great city,
and familiar old scenes, and the freedom from bad marks, and
being ruled into bounds, and sent to bed at early hours.&nbsp;
There is, in certain cases, a degree of moral restraint and
discipline which is often carried much too far, especially where
boys are brought up with a view to pushing themselves in the
world.&nbsp; I was sixteen years of age and six feet high before
I was allowed to leave off short jackets, go to a theatre, or
travel alone, all of which was more injurious to <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>me, I
believe, than ordinary youthful dissipation would have been,
especially in America.&nbsp; Yet, while thus repressed, I was
being continually referred by all grown-up friends to
enterprising youth of my own age, who were making a living in
bankers&rsquo; or conveyancers&rsquo; offices, &amp;c., and
acting &ldquo;like men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result really being that
I was completely convinced that I was a person of feeble and
inferior capacity as regarded all that was worth doing or knowing
in life, though Heaven knows my very delicate health and long
illnesses might of themselves have excused all my failings.&nbsp;
The vast majority of Americans, however kind and generous they
may be in other respects, are absolutely without mercy or
common-sense as regards the not succeeding in life or making
money.&nbsp; Such, at least, was my experience, and bitter it
was.&nbsp; Elders often forget that even obedience, civility, and
morality in youth are luxuries which must be paid for like all
other extravagances at a high price, especially in children of
feeble constitution.&nbsp; The dear boy grows up &ldquo;as good
as pie,&rdquo; and, being pious, &ldquo;does not know one card
from another,&rdquo; nor one human being from another.&nbsp; You
make of him a fool, and then call him one&mdash;I mean, what you
regard as a fool.&nbsp; I am not at all sure that one or two
cruises in a slaver (there were plenty of them sailing out of New
York in those days) would not have done me far more good of a
certain kind than all the education I had till I left college in
America.&nbsp; I am not here complaining, as most weak men do, as
if they were specially victims to a wretched fate and a
might-have-been-better.&nbsp; The vast majority of boys have not
better homes or education, kinder parents, or advantages greater
than mine were.&nbsp; But as I do not recall my boyhood&rsquo;s
days or my youth till I left college with that <i>joyousness</i>
which I find in other men without exception, and as, in fact,
there always seems as if a cloud were over it all, while from
below there was a low continual murmur as of a patient soul in
pain, I feel that there was something wrong in it all, as there
indeed was&mdash;the wrong of taking all the starch out of a
shirt, and then wondering <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>that it was
not stiff.&nbsp; But I must say, at the same time, that this free
expansion is not required by the vast majority of boys, who are
only far too ready and able to spread themselves into
&ldquo;life&rdquo; without any aid whatever.&nbsp; What is for
one meat may be for another poison, and mine was a very
exceptional case, which required very peculiar treatment.</p>
<p>My father had sold out his business in 1832 to Mr. Charles S.
Boker, and since then been principally engaged in real estate and
stock speculation.&nbsp; When I returned, he had bought a large
property between Chestnut Market and Third Streets, on which was
a hotel called Congress Hall, with which there were connected
many historical associations, for most of the noted men who for
many years visited Philadelphia had lived in it.&nbsp; With it
were stables and other buildings, covering a great deal of ground
in the busiest portion of the city, but still not in its
condition very profitable.&nbsp; Then, again, he purchased the
old Arch Street prison, a vast gloomy pile, like four dead walls,
a building nearly 400 feet square.&nbsp; It was empty, and I went
over it and into the cells many times.&nbsp; I remember thinking
of the misery and degradation of those who had been confined
there.&nbsp; The discipline had been bad enough, for the
prisoners had been allowed to herd freely together.&nbsp; My
father tore it down, and built a block of handsome
dwelling-houses on its site.&nbsp; As the <i>trottoir</i> or
side-walk was narrow, he, at a considerable loss to himself, made
a present to the city of a strip of land which left a wide
pavement.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;at a loss,&rdquo; for had the houses
been deeper they would have sold for much more.&nbsp; The City
Council graciously accepted the gift, with the special condition
that my father should pay all the expenses of the transfer!&nbsp;
From which I learned the lesson that in this life a man is quite
as liable to suffer from doing good as doing evil, unless he
employs just as much foresight or caution in the doing
thereof.&nbsp; Some of the most deeply regretted acts of my life,
which have caused me most sincere and oft-renewed repentance,
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>were altogether and perfectly acts of generosity and
goodness.&nbsp; The simple truth of which is that a <i>gush</i>,
no matter how sweet and pure the water may be, generally
displaces something.&nbsp; Many more buildings did my father buy
and sell, but committed withal the very serious error of never
buying a house as a permanent home or a country place, which he
might have easily done, and even to great profit, which error in
the long-run caused us all great inconvenience, and much of that
shifting from place to place which is very bad for a growing
family.&nbsp; The humblest man in such case in a house of his own
has certain great advantages over even a millionaire in
lodgings.</p>
<p>Mr. S. C. Walker had given over his school to a younger
brother named Joseph, but it was still kept in the old house in
Eighth Street, where also I had taken my lessons in the rudiments
of Transcendentalism from the Orphic Alcott.&nbsp; It was now a
fairly good school as things went in those days, with the same
lectures in Natural Philosophy and Chemistry&mdash;the same mild
doses of French and Latin.&nbsp; The chief assistant was E. Otis
Kimball, subsequently a professor of astronomy, a very
gentlemanly and capable instructor, of a much higher type than
any assistant-teacher whom I had ever before met.&nbsp; Under him
I read Voltaire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Charles the Twelfth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
George H. Boker, who was one year older than I, and the son of my
father&rsquo;s old partner, went to this school.&nbsp; I do not
remember that for the first year or eighteen mouths after my
return to Philadelphia there was any incident of note in my life,
or that I read anything unless it was Shakespeare, and reviews
which much influenced me.&nbsp; However, I was very wisely
allowed to attend a gymnasium, kept by a man named Hudson.&nbsp;
Here there was a sporting tone, much pistol-shooting at a mark,
boxing and fencing, prints of prize-fighters on the wall, and
cuts from <i>Life in London</i>, with copious cigar-smoke.&nbsp;
It was a wholesome, healthy place for me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
could not afford the shooting, boxing, &amp;c., but I profited
somewhat by it, both morally <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and
physically.&nbsp; At this critical period, or a little later, a
few pounds a year judiciously invested in sport and
&ldquo;dissipation&rdquo; would have changed the whole current of
my life, probably much for the better, and it would certainly
have spared my poor father the conviction, which he had almost to
his death, that I was a sad and mortifying failure or exception
which had not paid its investment; for which opinion he was in no
wise to blame, it being also that of all his business
acquaintances, many of whose sons, it was true, went utterly to
the devil, but then it was in the ancient intelligible,
common-sensible, usual paths of gambling, horsing,
stock-brokering, selling short, or ruining all their relatives by
speculating with their money.&nbsp; However, there was also
the&mdash;rather forlorn&mdash;hope ahead that I would do
something in a profession.</p>
<p>The school went on, Mr. Walker studying law meantime till he
had passed his examination, when it was transferred to Mr. B. P.
Hunt.&nbsp; With this man, who became and remained my intimate
friend till his death, thirty years after, came the first faint
intimation of what was destined to be the most critical, the most
singular, and by far the most important period of my life.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt was, as he himself declared to me in after years, not
at all fitted to be a schoolmaster.&nbsp; He lacked the minor or
petty earnestness of character, and even the training or
preparation, necessary for such work.&nbsp; On the other hand, he
had read a great deal in a desultory way; he was very fond of all
kinds of easy literature; and when he found that any boy
understood the subject, he would talk with that boy about
whatever he had been reading.&nbsp; Yet there was something real
and stimulative in him, for there never was a man in Philadelphia
who kept school for so short a time and with so few pupils who
had among them so many who in after life became more or less
celebrated.&nbsp; For he certainly made all of us who were above
idiocy think and live in thought above the ordinary range of
school-boy life.&nbsp; Thus I can recall these two out of many
incidents:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Finding me one day at an old book-stand, he explained to
me Alduses, and Elzevirs, and bibliography, showing me several
specimens, all of which I remembered.</p>
<p>I had read Watson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Annals of
Philadelphia.&rdquo;&nbsp; [By the way, I knew the daughter of
the author.]&nbsp; There was an allusion in it to Cornelius
Agrippa, and Mr. Hunt explained and dilated on this great
sorcerer to me till I became half crazy to read the &ldquo;Occult
Philosophy,&rdquo; which I did at a roaring rate two years
later.</p>
<p>One day I saw Mr. Hunt and Mr. Kendall chuckling together over
a book.&nbsp; I divined a secret.&nbsp; Now, I was a very
honourable boy, and never pried into secrets, but where a quaint
old book was concerned I had no more conscience than a
pirate.&nbsp; And seeing Mr. Hunt put the book into his desk, I
abode my time till he had gone forth, when I raised the lid, and
. . .</p>
<p>Merciful angels and benevolent fairies! it was
Urquhart&rsquo;s translation of Rabelais!&nbsp; One short spell I
read, no more; but it raised a devil which has never since been
laid.&nbsp; Ear hath not heard, it hath not entered into the
heart of man to conceive, what I felt as I realised, like a young
giant just awakened, that there was in me a stupendous mental
strength to grasp and understand that magnificent mixture of
ribaldry and learning, fun and wisdom, deviltry and
divinity.&nbsp; In a few pages&rsquo; time I knew what it all
meant, and that I was gifted to understand it.&nbsp; I replaced
the book; nor did I read it again for years, but from that hour I
was never quite the same person.&nbsp; The next day I saw
Callot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Temptation of St. Anthony&rdquo; for the
first time in a shop-window, and felt with joy and pride that I
understood it out of Rabelais.&nbsp; Two young
gentlemen&mdash;lawyers apparently&mdash;by my side thought it
was crazy and silly.&nbsp; To me it was more like an
apocalypse.</p>
<p>I am speaking plain truth when I say that that one quarter of
an hour&rsquo;s reading of Rabelais&mdash;standing up&mdash;was
to me as the light which flashed upon Saul journeying to <!--
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Damascus.&nbsp; It seems to me now as if it were the
great event of my life.&nbsp; It came to such a pass in after
years that I could have identified any line in the Chronicle of
Gargantua, and I also was the suggester, father, and founder in
London of the Rabelais Club, in which were many of the best minds
of the time, but beyond it all and brighter than all was that
first revelation.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that I had already perused Sterne,
much of Swift, and far more comic and satiric literature than is
known to boys, and, what is far more remarkable, had thoroughly
taken it all into my <i>cor cordium</i> by much repetition and
reflection.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt in time put me up to a great deal of very valuable or
curious <i>belletristic</i> fair-lettered or black-lettered
reading, far beyond my years, though not beyond my intelligence
and love.&nbsp; We had been accustomed to pass to our back-gate
of the school through Blackberry Alley&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blackberry Alley, now Duponceau Street,<br
/>
A rose by any name will smell as sweet&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which was tenanted principally by social evils.&nbsp; He
removed to the corner of Seventh and Chestnut Streets.&nbsp;
Under our schoolroom there was a gambling den.&nbsp; I am not
aware that these surroundings had any effect whatever upon the
pupils.&nbsp; Among the pupils in Seventh Street was one named
Emile Tourtel&ocirc;t.&nbsp; We called him Oatmeal
Turtledove.&nbsp; I had another friend who was newly come from
Connecticut.&nbsp; His uncle kept a hotel and often gave him
Havanna cigars.&nbsp; We often took long walks together out of
town and smoked them.&nbsp; He taught me the song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Springfield mountains there did
dwell,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with much more quaint rural New England lore.</p>
<p>About this time my grandfather Leland died.&nbsp; I wept sadly
on hearing it.&nbsp; My father, who went to Holliston to attend
the funeral, brought me back a fine collection of <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Indian stone relics and old American silver coins, for
he had been in his way an antiquarian.&nbsp; <i>Bon sang ne peut
mentir</i>.&nbsp; I had also the certificate of some Society or
Order of Revolutionary soldiers to which he had belonged.&nbsp;
One of his brothers had, as an officer, a membership of the
hereditary Order of the Cincinnati.&nbsp; This passed to another
branch of the family.</p>
<p>For many years the principal regular visitor at our house was
Mr. Robert Stewart, a gentleman of good family and excellent
education, who had during the wars with Napoleon made an
adventurous voyage to France, and subsequently passed most of his
life as Consul or diplomatic agent in Cuba.&nbsp; He had brought
with him from Cuba a black Ebo-African slave named Juan.&nbsp; As
the latter seemed to be discontented in Philadelphia, Mr.
Stewart, who was kindness itself, offered to send him back freed
to Cuba or Africa, and told him he might buy a modest outfit of
clothing, such as suited his condition.&nbsp; The negro went to a
first-class tailor and ordered splendid clothes, which were sent
back, of course.&nbsp; The vindictive Ebo was so angry at this,
that one summer afternoon, while Mr. Stewart slept, the former
fell on him with an axe and knife, mangled his head horribly, cut
the cords of his hand, &amp;c., and thought he had killed
him.&nbsp; But hearing his victim groan, he was returning, when
he met another servant, who said, &ldquo;Juan, where are you
going?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Me begin to kill
Mars&rsquo; Stewart&mdash;now me go back finish him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was, of course, promptly arrested.&nbsp; Mr. Stewart
recovered, but was always blind of one eye, and his right hand
was almost useless.&nbsp; Mr. Stewart had in his diplomatic
capacity seen many of the pirates who abounded on the Spanish
Main in those days.&nbsp; He was an admirable <i>raconteur</i>,
abounding in reminiscences.&nbsp; His son William inherited from
an uncle a Cuban estate worth millions of dollars, and lived many
years in Paris.&nbsp; He was a great patron of (especially
Spanish) art.</p>
<p>So I passed on to my fourteenth year, which was destined <!--
page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>to be the beginning of the most critical period of my
life.&nbsp; My illnesses had increased in number and severity,
and I had shot up into a very tall weak youth.&nbsp; Mr. Hunt
gave up teaching, and became editor of <i>Littell&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; I was sent to the school of Mr.
Hurlbut&mdash;as I believe it was then spelled, but I may be
wrong.&nbsp; He had been a Unitarian clergyman, but was an
ungenial, formal, rather harsh man&mdash;the very opposite of Mr.
Hunt.&nbsp; My schoolmates soon found that though so tall, I was
physically very weak, and many of them continually bullied and
annoyed me.&nbsp; Once I was driven into a formal stand-up fight
with one younger by a year, but much stronger.&nbsp; I did my
best, but was beaten.&nbsp; I offered to fight him then in Indian
fashion with a hug, but this he scornfully declined.&nbsp; After
this he never met me without insulting me, for he had a base
nature, as his after-life proved.&nbsp; These humiliations had a
bad effect upon me, for I was proud and nervous, and, like many
such boys, often very foolish.</p>
<p>But I had a few very good friends.&nbsp; Among these was
Charles Macalester.&nbsp; One day when I had been bullied
shamefully by the knot of boys who always treated me badly, he
ran after me up Walnut Street, and, almost with tears in his
eyes, assured me of his sympathy.&nbsp; There were two other
intimates.&nbsp; George Patrullo, of Spanish parentage, and
Richard Seldener, son of the Swedish Consul.&nbsp; They read a
great deal.&nbsp; One day it chanced that Seldener had in his
bosom a very large old-fashioned flint-lock horse-pistol loaded
with shot.&nbsp; By him and me stood Patrullo and William Henry
Hurlbut, who has since become a very well-known character.&nbsp;
Thinking that Seldener&rsquo;s pistol was unloaded, Patrullo, to
frighten young Hurlbut, pulled the weapon suddenly from
Seldener&rsquo;s breast, put it between Hurlbut&rsquo;s eyes and
fired.&nbsp; The latter naturally started to one side, so it
happened that he only received one shot in his ear.&nbsp; The
charge went into the wall, where it made a mark like a
bullet&rsquo;s, which was long visible.&nbsp; George Patrullo was
drowned not long after while <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>swimming in
the Schuylkill river, and Richard Seldener perished on an
Atlantic steamer, which was never heard of.</p>
<p>On the other hand, something took place which cast a
marvellous light into this darkened life of mine.&nbsp; For one
day my father bought and presented to me a share in the
Philadelphia Library.&nbsp; This was a collection which even then
consisted of more than 60,000 well-chosen volumes.&nbsp; And then
began such a life of reading as was, I sincerely believe, unusual
in such youth.&nbsp; My first book was &ldquo;Arthur of Little
Britaine,&rdquo; which I finished in a week; then &ldquo;Newes
from New Englande, 1636,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Historie of
Clodoaldus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before long I discovered that there were
in the Loganian section of the library several hundred volumes of
occult philosophy, a collection once formed by an artist named
Cox, and of these I really read nearly every one.&nbsp; Cornelius
Agrippa and Barret&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magus,&rdquo; Paracelsus, the
black-letter edition of Reginald Scot, Glanville, and Gaffarel,
Trithemius, Baptista Porta, and God knows how many Rosicrucian
writers became familiar to me.&nbsp; Once when I had only
twenty-five cents I gave it for a copy of &ldquo;Waters of the
East&rdquo; by Eugenius Philalethes, or Thomas Vaughan.</p>
<p>All of this led me to the Mystics and Quietists.&nbsp; I read
Dr. Boardman&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Quakerism,&rdquo; which
taught me that Fox grew out of Behmen; and I picked up one day
Poiret&rsquo;s French work on the Mystics, which was quite a
handbook or guide to the whole literature.&nbsp; But these books
were but a small part of what I read; for at one time, taking
another turn towards old English, I went completely through
Chaucer and Gower, both in black letter, the collections of
Ritson, Weber, Ellis, and I know not how many more of
medi&aelig;val ballads and romances, and very thoroughly and
earnestly indeed Warton&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of English
Poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I read Sismondi&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Literature of Southern Europe&rdquo; and
Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poets and Poetry of Europe,&rdquo;
which set me to work on Raynouard and other collections of
Proven&ccedil;al poetry, in the knowledge of which I made some
progress, and also St. <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Pelaye&rsquo;s, Le Grand&rsquo;s,
Costello&rsquo;s, and other books on the Trouveurs.&nbsp; I
translated into rhyme and sent to a magazine, of which I in after
years became editor, one or two <i>la&iuml;s</i>, which were
rejected, I think unwisely, for they were by no means bad.&nbsp;
Then I had a fancy for Miscellanea, and read the works of
D&rsquo;Israeli the elder and Burton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Anatomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day I made a startling discovery, for I took at a venture
from the library the black-letter first edition of the poems of
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon.&nbsp; I was then fifteen years old.&nbsp;
Never shall I forget the feeling, which Heine compares to the
unexpected finding of a shaft of gold in a gloomy mine, which
shot through me as I read for the first time these
<i>ballades</i>.&nbsp; Now-a-days people are trained to them
through second-hand sentiment.&nbsp; Villon has
become&mdash;Heaven bless the mark!&mdash;<i>fashionable</i>! and
&aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; I got at him &ldquo;straight&rdquo; out of
black-letter reading in boyhood as a find of my own, and it was
many, many years ere I ever met with a single soul who had heard
of him.&nbsp; I at once translated the &ldquo;Song of the Ladies
of the Olden Time&rdquo;; and I knew what <i>bon bec</i> meant,
which is more than one of Villon&rsquo;s great modern translators
has done!&nbsp; Also <i>heaulmi&egrave;re</i>, which is
<i>not</i> helmet-maker, as another supposes.</p>
<p>I went further in this field than I have room to
describe.&nbsp; I even read the rococo-sweet poems of Joachim du
Bellay.&nbsp; In this year my father gave me &ldquo;The
Doctor,&rdquo; by Robert Southey, a work which I read and re-read
assiduously for many years, and was guided by it to a vast amount
of odd reading, Philemon Holland&rsquo;s translation of Pliny
being one of the books.&nbsp; This induced me to read all of
Southey&rsquo;s poems, which I did, not from the library, but
from a bookstore, where I had free run and borrowing privileges,
as I well might, since my father lost &pound;4,000 by its
owner.</p>
<p>While at Mr. Greene&rsquo;s school I had given me
Alsopp&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life and Letters of Coleridge,&rdquo; which
I read through many times; then in my thirteenth year, in
Philadelphia, I read with great love Charles Lamb&rsquo;s works
and most of the works <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>of Coleridge.&nbsp; Mr. Alcott had
read Wordsworth into us in illimitable quantities, so that I soon
had a fair all-round knowledge of the Lakers, whom I dearly
loved.&nbsp; Now there was a certain <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of
Mysticism or Transcendentalism and Pantheism in Coleridge, and
even in Wordsworth, which my love of rocks and rivers and fairy
lore easily enabled me to detect by sympathy.</p>
<p>But all of this was but a mere preparation for and
foreshadowing of a great mental development and very precocious
culture which was rapidly approaching.&nbsp; I now speak of what
happened to me from 1838 to 1840, principally in the latter
year.&nbsp; If I use extravagant, vain words, I beg the reader to
pardon me.&nbsp; Perhaps this will never be published, therefore
<i>sit verbo venia</i>!</p>
<p>I had become deeply interested in the new and bold development
which was then manifesting itself in the Unitarian Church.&nbsp;
Channing, whom I often heard preach, had something in common with
the Quietists; Mr. Furness was really a thinker &ldquo;out of
bounds,&rdquo; while in reality as gentle and purely Christian as
could be.&nbsp; There was something new in the air, and this
Something I, in an antiquated form, had actually preceded.&nbsp;
It was really only a <i>rechauff&eacute;</i> of the Neo-Platonism
which lay at the bottom of Porphyry, Proclus, Psellus,
Jamblichus, with all of whom I was fairly well acquainted.&nbsp;
Should any one doubt this, I can assure him that I still possess
a full copy of the &ldquo;Poemander&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Pimander&rdquo; of Hermes Trismegistus, made by me in my
sixteenth year, which most assuredly no mortal could ever have
understood or made, or cared to make, if he had not read the
Neo-Platonists; for Marsilius Ficinus himself regarded this work
as a pendant to them, and published it as such.&nbsp; Which work
I declared was not a Christian Platonic forgery, but based on old
Egyptian works, as has since been well-nigh proved from recent
discoveries.&nbsp; (I think it was Dr. Garnett who, hearing me
once declare in the British Museum that I believed Hermes was
based on an ancient Egyptian <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>text, sent
for a French work in which the same view was advanced.)</p>
<p>The ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and <i>odium theologicum</i>
which prevailed in America until 1840 was worse than that in
Europe under the Church in the Middle Ages, for even in the
latter there had been an Agobard and an Abelard, Knight-Templar
agnostics, and <i>illuminati</i> of different kinds.&nbsp; The
Unitarians, who believed firmly in every point of Christianity,
and that man was saved by Jesus, and would be damned if he did
not put faith in him as the Son of God, were regarded literally
and truly by everybody as no better than infidels because they
believed that Christ was <i>sent</i> by God, and that Three could
not be One.&nbsp; Every sect, with rare exceptions, preached,
especially the Presbyterians, that the vast majority even of
Christians would be damned, thereby giving to the devil that far
greater power than God against which Bishop Agobard had
protested.&nbsp; As for a freethinker or infidel, he was pointed
at in the streets; and if a man had even seen a
&ldquo;Deist,&rdquo; he spoke of it as if he had beheld a
murderer.&nbsp; Against all this some few were beginning to
revolt.</p>
<p>There came a rumour that there was something springing up in
Boston called Transcendentalism.&nbsp; Nobody knew what it was,
but it was dreamy, mystical, crazy, and infideleterious to
religion.&nbsp; Firstly, it was connected with Thomas Carlyle and
Ralph Waldo Emerson, and finally with everything German.&nbsp;
The new school of liberal Unitarians favoured it.&nbsp; I had a
quick intuition that here was something for me to work at.&nbsp;
I bought Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, first edition,
and read it through forty times ere I left college, of which I
&ldquo;kept count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My record here as regards some books may run a little ahead;
but either before I went to college or during my first year there
(almost all before or by 1840-&rsquo;41), I had read
Carlyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Miscellanies&rdquo; thoroughly,
Emerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essays,&rdquo; a translation of
Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Critique of Pure Reason,&rdquo; the first
half of it many times; Dugald Stewart&rsquo;s works, something
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>of Reid, Locke, and Hobbes&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Leviathan&rdquo;; had bought and read French versions of
Schelling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Transcendental Idealism&rdquo; and
Fichte&rsquo;s fascinating &ldquo;Destiny of Man&rdquo;; studied
a small handbook of German philosophy; the works of Campanella
and Vanini (Bruno much later, for his works were then exceeding
rare.&nbsp; I now have Weber&rsquo;s edition), and also, with
intense relish and great profit, an old English version of
Spinoza&rsquo;s <i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i>.&nbsp; In
which last work I had the real key and clue to all German
philosophy and Rationalism, as I in time found out.&nbsp; I must
here modestly mention that I had, to a degree which I honestly
believe seldom occurs, the art of <i>rapid</i> yet of
carefully-observant reading.&nbsp; George Boker once, quite
unknown to me, gave me something to read, watched my eyes as I
went from line to line, timed me by watch, and finally examined
me on what I had read.&nbsp; He published the incident long
after, said he had repeated it more than once <i>&agrave; mon
insu</i>, and that it was remarkable.</p>
<p>Such a dual life as I at this time led it has seldom entered
into the head of man to imagine.&nbsp; I was, on the one hand, a
school-boy in a jacket, leading a humiliated life among my kind,
all because I was sickly and weak; while, on the other hand,
utterly alone and without a living soul to whom I could exchange
an idea, I was mastering rapidly and boldly that which was
<i>then</i> in reality the tremendous problem of the age.&nbsp; I
can now see that, as regards its <i>real</i> antique bases, I was
far more deeply read and better grounded than were even its most
advanced leaders in Anglo-Saxony.&nbsp; For I soon detected in
Carlyle, and much more in Emerson, a very slender knowledge of
that stupendous and marvellous ancient Mysticism which sent its
soul in burning faith and power to the depth of &ldquo;the
downward-borne elements of God,&rdquo; as Hermes called
them.&nbsp; I missed even the rapt faith of such a weak writer as
Sir Kenelm Digby, much more Zoroaster!&nbsp; Vigourous and clever
and bold writers they were&mdash;Carlyle was far beyond me in
literary <i>art</i>&mdash;but true Pantheists they were
<i>not</i>.&nbsp; And they <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>were men of
great genius, issuing essays to the age on popular, or political,
or &ldquo;literary&rdquo; topics; but <i>philosophers</i> they
most assuredly were <i>not</i>, nor men tremendous in spiritual
truth.&nbsp; And yet it was precisely as <i>philosophers</i> and
thaumaturgists and revealers of <i>occulta</i> that they
posed&mdash;especially Emerson.&nbsp; And they dabbled or trifled
with free thought and &ldquo;immorality,&rdquo; crying Goethe up
as the Light of Lights, while all their inner souls were bound in
the most Puritanical and petty goody-goodyism.&nbsp; Though there
were traces of grim Scotch humour in Carlyle, my patron saint and
master, Rabelais, or aught like him, had no credit with them.</p>
<p>They <i>paddled</i> in Pantheism, but as regards it, both
lacked the stupendous faith and inspiration of the old adepti,
who flung their whole souls into God; and yet they sneered at
Materialism and Science.</p>
<p>I did not then see <i>all</i> of this so clearly as I now do,
but I very soon found that, as in after years it was said that
Comteism was Catholicism without Christianity, so the
Carlyle-Emersonian Transcendentalism was Mysticism without
mystery.&nbsp; Nor did I reflect that it was a calling people
from the nightmared slumber of frozen orthodoxy or bigotry to
come and see a marvellous new thing.&nbsp; And when they came,
they found out that this marvellous thing was that they had been
<i>awakened</i>, &ldquo;only that and nothing more&rdquo;; and
<i>that</i> was the great need of the time, and worth more than
any magic or theosophy.&nbsp; But I had expected, in simple
ignorant faith, that the sacred mysteries of some marvellous
cabala would be revealed, and not finding what I wanted (though
indeed I discovered much that was worldly new to me), I returned
to the good old ghost-haunted paths trodden by my ancestors, to
dryads and elves and voices from the stars, and the
<i>arch&aelig;us</i> formed by the astral spirit (not the modern
Blavatsky affair, by-the-bye), which entyped all things . . . and
so went elving and dreaming on &rsquo;mid ruins old.</p>
<p>Be it observed that all this time I really did not know what I
knew.&nbsp; Boys are greatly influenced by their surroundings,
<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>and in those days every one about me never spoke of
Transcendentalism or &ldquo;Germanism,&rdquo; or even
&ldquo;bookishness,&rdquo; without a sneer.&nbsp; I was borne by
a mysterious inner impulse which I could not resist into this
terrible whirlpool of <i>belles-lettres</i>, occulta,
faceti&aelig;, and philosophy; but I had, God knows, little cause
for pride that I read so much, for it was on every hand in some
way turned against me.&nbsp; If it had only been reading like
that of other human beings, it might have been endured; but I was
always seen coming and going with parchment-bound tomes.&nbsp;
Once I implored my father, when I was thirteen or fourteen, to
let me buy a certain book, which he did.&nbsp; This work, which
was as dear to me as a new doll to a girl for a long time, was
the <i>Reductorium</i> or moralisation of the whole Bible by
Petrus Berchorius, black-letter, folio, Basle, 1511.&nbsp; It was
from the library of a great and honest scholar, and, as the
catalogue stated, &ldquo;contained MS. notes on the margin by
Melanchthon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promising, this, for an American youth who was expected to go
into business or study a profession!</p>
<p>While at Hurlbut&rsquo;s school I took lessons in
Spanish.&nbsp; There was a Spanish boy from Malaga, a kind of
half-servant, <i>half-prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> in a family near
us, with whom I practised speaking the language, and also had
some opportunity with a few Cubans who visited our family.&nbsp;
One of them had been a governor-general.&nbsp; He was a Gallician
by birth, but I did not know this, and innocently asked him one
day if <i>los Gallegos no son los Irlandeses
d&rsquo;Espa&ntilde;a</i>?&mdash;if the Gallicians were not the
Irish of Spain&mdash;which drew a grave caution from my brother,
who knew better than I how the land lay.&nbsp; I really attained
some skill in Spanish, albeit to this day &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo; demands from me a great deal of dictionary.&nbsp;
But, as I said before, I learn languages with <i>incredible</i>
difficulty, a fact which I cannot reconcile with the extreme
interest which I take in philology and linguistics, and the
discoveries which I have made; as, for instance, that of
<i>Shelta</i> in England, or my labours in jargons, such as
Pidgin-English, Slang, and <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Romany.&nbsp;
But, as the reader has probably perceived, I was a boy with an
inherited good constitution only from the paternal side, and a
not very robust one from my mother, while my mind, weakened by
long illness, had been strangely stimulated by many disorders,
nervous fevers being frequent among them.&nbsp; In those days I
was, as my mother said, almost brought up on calomel&mdash;and
she might have added quinine.&nbsp; The result of so much
nervousness, excessive stimulating by medicine, and rapid growth
was a too great susceptibility to poetry, humour, art, and all
that was romantic, quaint, and mysterious, while I found it very
hard to master any really dry subject.&nbsp; What would have set
me all right would have been careful physical culture, boxing, so
as to protect me from my school persecutors, and <i>amusement</i>
in a healthy sense, of which I had almost none whatever.</p>
<p>Hurlbut&rsquo;s became at last simply intolerable, and my
parents, finding out in some way that I was worse for being
there, removed me to a far better school kept by E. C. Wines, who
had written books on education, and attained some fame
thereby.&nbsp; This was in 1839-&rsquo;40, and I was there to be
prepared for college.&nbsp; We were soon introduced to an old
French gentleman, who was to teach us, and who asked the other
boys what French works they had read.&nbsp; Some had gone through
<i>Tel&eacute;maque</i>, or <i>Paul et Virginie</i>,
<i>Florian</i>, <i>etcetera</i>.&nbsp; The good-goody nature of
such reading awoke in me my sense of humour.&nbsp; When it came
to my turn, and I was asked, I replied, &ldquo;<i>La Pucelle
d&rsquo;Orleans</i> and <i>Dictionnaire Philosophique</i> of
Voltaire, the Confessions of Rousseau, the Poems of Villon,
<i>Charles d&rsquo;Orleans</i>, <i>Clotilde de Surville</i>, and
more or less of Helvetius, D&rsquo;Holbach, and
Condillac.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the professor, feeling himself
quizzed, cast forth his hands as in disgust and horror, and
cried, &ldquo;<i>Assez</i>! <i>assez</i>!&nbsp; Unhappy boy, you
have raked through the library of the devil down to the
dregs!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was I &ldquo;selling&rdquo; him, for I
certainly had read the works, as the records of the Philadelphia
Library can in a great measure prove, and did not speak by
hearsay.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>I had at this time several severe long attacks of
illness with much pain, which I always bore well, as a matter of
course or habit.&nbsp; But rather oddly, while in the midst of my
Transcendentalism, and reading every scrap of everything about
Germany which I could get, and metaphysics, and study&mdash;I was
very far gone then, and used to go home from school and light a
pipe with a long wooden stem, and study the beloved &ldquo;Critic
of Pure Reason&rdquo; or Carlyle&rsquo;s Miscellanies, having
discovered that smoking was absolutely necessary in such
reading&mdash;[De Quincey required a quart of laudanum to enable
him to enjoy German metaphysics]&mdash;there came a strange gleam
of worldly dissipation, of which I never think without
pleasure.&nbsp; I had passed one summer vacation on a farm near
Philadelphia, where I learned something in wood-ranging about
wild herbs and catching land-tortoises and
&ldquo;coon-hunting,&rdquo; and had been allowed to hire and ride
a horse.</p>
<p>I did not know it, but this horse had thrown over his head
everybody who had ever mounted him.&nbsp; He was a perfect devil,
but also a perfect gentleman.&nbsp; He soon took my measure, and
resolved to treat me kindly as a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; When we both wanted a gallop,
he made such time as nobody before had dreamed was in him; when
he was lazy, he only had to turn his head and look at me, and I
knew what that meant and conformed unto him.&nbsp; He had a queer
fancy at times to quietly steal up and put his hoof on my foot so
as to hurt me, and then there was an impish laugh in his
eye.&nbsp; For he laughed at me, and I knew it.&nbsp; There is
really such a thing as a horse-laugh.&nbsp; One day we passed
through a drove of sheep, and he did not like it&mdash;no horse
does.&nbsp; After a while I wanted to go by a certain road, but
he refused sternly to take it.&nbsp; I found soon after that if I
had done so we must have met the sheep again.&nbsp; He had, in
fact, understood the route far better than I.&nbsp; I once got a
mile out of him in three minutes&mdash;more or less; but he had
seen me look at my watch, and knew that I wanted to see what he
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>could do.&nbsp; He never did it again.&nbsp; I
<i>may</i> have been mistaken here, but it was my impression at
the time.&nbsp; Perhaps if I had gone on much longer in intimacy
with him I might have profited mentally by it, and acquired what
Americans call &ldquo;horse-sense,&rdquo; of which I had some
need.&nbsp; It is the sixth&mdash;or the first&mdash;sense of all
Yankees and Scotchmen.&nbsp; When I returned to the city I was
allowed to hire a horse for a few times from a livery stable, and
went out riding with a friend.&nbsp; This friend was a rather
precociously dissipated youth, and with him I had actually now
and then&mdash;very rarely&mdash;a glass at a bar and
oysters.&nbsp; He soon left me for wilder associates, and I
relapsed into my old sober habits.&nbsp; Strange as it may seem,
I believe that I was really on the brink of becoming like other
boys.&nbsp; But it all faded away.&nbsp; Now it became imperative
that I should study in earnest.&nbsp; I used to rise at three or
four in the morning.&nbsp; What with hard work and great fear of
not passing my matriculation, I contrived to get up so much
Latin, Greek, and mathematics, that Mr. Wines thought I might
attempt it, and so one fine summer day my father went with me to
Princeton.&nbsp; I was in a fearful state of nervous anxiety.</p>
<h3>COLLEGE LIFE.</h3>
<h4>PRINCETON.</h4>
<p>We went to Princeton, where I presented my letters of
introduction, passed a by no means severe examination for the
Freshman&rsquo;s class, was very courteously received by the
professors to whom I was commended, and, to my inexpressible
delight, found myself a college student.&nbsp; Rooms were secured
for me at a Mrs. Burroughs&rsquo;, opposite Nassau Hall; the
adjoining apartment was occupied by Mr. Craig Biddle, now a
judge.&nbsp; George H. Boker was then at the end of his Sophomore
year, the term having but a few days to run.&nbsp; He had rooms
in college and lived in unexampled style, having actually a
carpet on his floor and superior furniture, also a <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>good
collection of books, chiefly standard English poets.&nbsp; He at
once took me in hand and gave me a character.</p>
<p>Princeton College was entirely in the hands of the strictest
of &ldquo;Old School&rdquo; Presbyterian theologians.&nbsp; Piety
and mathematics rated extravagantly high in the course.&nbsp; The
latter study was literally reckoned in the grades as being of
more account than all the rest collectively.&nbsp; Thus, as
eventually happened to me, a student might excel in Latin,
English, and Natural Philosophy&mdash;in fact, in almost
everything, good conduct included&mdash;and yet be the last in
the class if he neglected mathematics.&nbsp; There was no
teaching of French, because, as was na&iuml;vely said, students
might read the irreligious works extant in that language, and of
course no other modern language; as for German, one would as soon
have proposed to raise the devil there as a class in it.&nbsp; If
there had been an optional course, as at Cambridge,
Massachusetts, by which German was accepted in lieu of
mathematics, I should probably have taken the first honour,
instead of the last.&nbsp; And yet, with a little more Latin, I
was really qualified, on the day when I matriculated at
Princeton, to have passed for a Doctor of Philosophy in
Heidelberg, as I subsequently accurately ascertained.</p>
<p>There were three or four men of great ability in the Faculty
of the University.&nbsp; One of these was Professor Joseph Henry,
in those days the first natural philosopher and lecturer on
science in America.&nbsp; I had the fortune in time to become
quite a special <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of his.&nbsp;
Another was Professor James Alexander, who taught Latin,
rhetoric, and mental philosophy.&nbsp; He was so clear-headed and
liberally learned, that I always felt sure that he must at heart
have been far beyond the bounds of Old School theology, but he
had an iron Roman-like sternness of glance which quite suited a
Covenanter.&nbsp; The most remarkable of all was Albert Dodd,
Professor of Mathematics and Lecturer on Architecture.&nbsp; This
man was a genius of such a high order, that had it not been for
the false position in which he was placed, he would have <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>given to the world great works.&nbsp; The false position
was this: he was the chief pulpit orator of the old school, and
had made war on the Transcendentalist movement in an able article
in the <i>Princeton Review</i> (which, by the way, was useful in
guiding me to certain prohibited works, before unknown to
me).&nbsp; But as he was a man of poetic genial feeling, he found
himself irresistibly fascinated by what he had hunted down, and
so read Plato, and when he died actually left behind him a
manuscript translation of Spinoza&rsquo;s works!</p>
<p>The reader may imagine what a marvellous <i>find</i> I was to
him.&nbsp; George Boker, who was ages beyond me in knowledge of
the world&mdash;man and woman&mdash;said one day that he could
imagine how Dodd sat and chuckled to hear me talk, which remark I
did not at all understand and thought rather stupid.&nbsp; I
remember that during my first call on him we discussed <i>Sartor
Resartus</i>, and I expressed it as my firm conviction that the
idea of the Clothes Philosophy had been taken from the Treatise
on Fire and Salt by the Rosicrucian Lord Blaise.&nbsp; Then, in
all <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and innocence of effect, I
discussed some point in Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Critic,&rdquo; and a
few other trifles not usually familiar to sub-Freshmen, and took
my departure, very much pleased at having entered on a life where
my favourite reading did not really seem to be quite silly or
disreputable.&nbsp; I remember, however, being very much
surprised indeed at finding that the other students, in whom I
expected to encounter miracles of learning, or youth far superior
to myself in erudition and critical knowledge, did not quite come
up to my anticipations.&nbsp; However, as they were all far
beyond me in mathematics, I supposed their genius had all gone in
that direction, for well I knew that the toughest page in Fichte
was a mere trifle compared to the awful terrors of the Rule of
Three, and so treated them as young men who were my superiors in
other and greater things.</p>
<p>There were wearisome morning prayers in the chapel, and
roll-call every morning, and then an hour of recitation before
breakfast, study till ten or eleven, study and recitation in the
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>afternoon, and evening prayers again and study in the
evening.&nbsp; The Sabbath was anything but a day of rest, for we
had the same prayers; morning attendance at church; afternoon,
the learning and reciting of <i>four chapters</i> in the Bible;
while we were expected in the evening to master one or two
chapters in the Greek Testament.&nbsp; I am not sorry that I used
to read books during sermon-time.&nbsp; It kept me from, or from
me, a great deal of wickedness.&nbsp; <i>Videlicet</i>:</p>
<p>The sermons consisted principally of assertion that man
himself consisted chiefly of original sin.&nbsp; As evil
communications corrupt good manners, I myself, being young and
impressionable, began to believe that I too was an awful
sinner.&nbsp; Not knowing where else to look for it, I concluded
that it consisted in my inability to learn mathematics.&nbsp; I
do not distinctly remember whether I prayed to Heaven that I
might be able to cross the Pons Asinorum, but
&ldquo;anyway&rdquo; my prayer was granted when I graduated.</p>
<p>Another stock-piece in the <i>repertoire</i> consisted of
attacks on Voltaire, Tom Paine, and other antiquated Deists or
infidels.&nbsp; I had read with great contempt a copy of
&ldquo;The Rights of Man&rdquo; belonging to my genial uncle
Amos.&nbsp; I say with great contempt, for I always despised that
kind of free thought which consisted chiefly of enmity to
Christianity.&nbsp; Now I can see that Voltaire and his followers
were quite in the right in warring on terrible and immediate
abuses which oppressed mankind; but I had learned from Spinoza to
believe that every form of faith was good in its way or according
to its mission or time, and that it was silly to ridicule
Christianity because the tale of Balaam&rsquo;s ass was
incredible.&nbsp; Paine was to me just what a Positivist now is
to a Darwinian or Agnostic, and such preaching against
&ldquo;infidels&rdquo; seemed to me like pouring water on a
drowned mouse.&nbsp; There had always been in Mr. Furness&rsquo;s
teaching a very decided degree of Rationalism, and I had advanced
far more boldly on the track.&nbsp; I remember reading
translations from Schleiermacher and buying Strauss&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life of Jesus&rdquo; before I went to Princeton&mdash;<!--
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>I saw Strauss himself in after years at Weinsberg, in
Germany&mdash;but at Princeton the slightest approach to
explaining the most absurd story in the Old Testament was
regarded as out-and-out atheism.&nbsp; It had all happened, we
were told, just as it is described.</p>
<p>I may as well note here the fact that for many years in my
early life such a thing as only reading a book through once
rarely happened, when I could obtain it long enough.&nbsp; Even
the translations of the Neo-Platonists, with Campanella, Vanini,
or the Italian naturalists, were read and reread, while the
principal English poets, and such books as I owned, were perused
daily.</p>
<p>And here in this great infant arithmetic school I was in due
time set down to study Paley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Evidences of
Christianity&rdquo; and Locke on the Understanding&mdash;like
Carlyle&rsquo;s young lion invited to a feast of chickweed.&nbsp;
Apropos of the first, I have a droll reminiscence.&nbsp; There
had been in Philadelphia two years before a sale of a fine
library, and I had been heart-broken because my means had not
permitted me to buy the works of Sir Kenelm Digby.&nbsp; However,
I found them in the Princeton College Library.&nbsp; The first
thing I came to in Paley was his famous simile of the
watch&mdash;taken bodily and without acknowledgment from
Digby.&nbsp; The theft disgusted me.&nbsp; &ldquo;These be your
Christian champions!&rdquo; I thought&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Would any of the stock of infidels<br />
Had been my evidence ere such a Christian!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, moreover, Paley forgets to inform us what conclusion the
finder might draw if he had picked up a badly made watch which
did not keep good time&mdash;like this our turnip of a world at
times!</p>
<p>As we were obliged to attend divine service strictly on
Sunday, I was allowed to go to the Episcopal church in the
village, which agreed very well with my parents&rsquo;
views.&nbsp; I quite fell into the sentiment of the sect, and so
went to Professor Dodd to ask for permission from the Faculty to
change <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>my religion.&nbsp; When he asked me
how it was that I had renegaded into Trinitarianism, I replied
that it was due to reflection on the perfectly obvious and usual
road of the Platonic hypostases eked out with Gnosticism.&nbsp; I
had found in the College Library, and read with great pleasure
almost as soon as I got there, Cudworth&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Intellectual System&rdquo; (I raided a copy as <i>loot</i>
from a house in Tennessee in after years, during the war), and
learned from it that &ldquo;it was a religious instinct of man to
begin with a Trinity, in which I was much aided by Schelling, and
that there was no trace of a Trinity in the Bible, or rather the
contrary, yet that it <i>ought</i> consistently to have been
there&rdquo;&mdash;a sentiment which provoked from Professor Dodd
a long whistle like that of Uncle Toby with Lilliburlero.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; as I ingeniously represented, &ldquo;man or
God consists of the Monad from which developed spirit or
intellect and soul; for <i>toto enim in mundo lucet Trias cujus
Monas est princeps</i>, as the creed of the Rosicrucians begins
(which is taken from the Zoroastrian oracles)&rdquo;&mdash;here
there was another long subdued whistle&mdash;&ldquo;and it is set
forth on the face of every Egyptian temple as the ball, the wings
of the spirit which rusheth into all worlds, and the serpent,
which is the <i>Logos</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the whistle became
more sympathetic, for Egypt was the professor&rsquo;s great point
in his lectures on architecture.&nbsp; And having thus explained
the true grounds of the Trinity to the most learned theologian of
the Presbyterian sect, I took my leave, quite unconscious that I
had said anything out of the common, for all I meant was to give
my reasons for going back to the Episcopal Church.&nbsp; As for
Professor Dodd, he had given me up from the very first interview
to follow my idols as I pleased, only just throwing in argument
enough to keep me well going.&nbsp; He would have been the last
man on earth to throw down such a marvellous fairy castle,
goblin-built and elfin-tenanted, from whose windows rang
&AElig;olian harps, and which was lit by night with undying
Rosicrucian lamps, to erect on its ruin a plain brick, Old School
Presbyterian slated <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>chapel.&nbsp; I was far more amusing
as I was, and so I was let alone.</p>
<p>I had passed my examination about the end of June, and I was
to remain in Princeton until the autumn, reading under a tutor,
in the hope of being able to join the Sophomore class when the
college course should begin.&nbsp; There I was utterly alone, and
rambled by myself in the woods.&nbsp; I believed myself to be a
very good Christian in those days; but I was really as unaffected
and sincere a Poly-Pantheist or Old Nature heathen as ever lived
in Etrusco-Roman or early German days.&nbsp; A book very dear to
my heart at that time was the <i>Curiositez Inouyes</i> of
Gaffarel (Trollope was under the impression that he was the only
man in Europe who ever read it), in which there is an exquisite
theory that the stars of heaven in their courses and the lines of
winding rivers and bending corn, the curves of shells and
minerals, rocks and trees, yes, of all the shapes of all created
things, form the trace and letters of a stupendous <i>writing</i>
or characters spread all over the universe, which writing becomes
little by little legible to the one who by communion with Nature
and earnest faith seeks to penetrate the secret.&nbsp; I had
found in the lonely woods a small pond by a high rock, where I
often sat in order to attain this blessed illumination, and if I
did not get quite so far as I hoped, I did in reality attain to a
deep unconscious familiarity with birds and leafy shades, still
waters, and high rising trees; in short, with all the sweet
solemnity of sylvan nature, which has ever since influenced all
my life.&nbsp; I mean this not in the second-hand way in which it
is so generally understood, but as a <i>real</i> existence in
itself, so earnestly felt that I was but little short of talking
with elfin beings or seeing fairies flitting over flowers.&nbsp;
Those who explain everything by &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; do not
in the least understand how <i>actual</i> the life in Nature may
become to us.&nbsp; Reflect for a minute, thou whose whole soul
is in gossip and petty chronicles of fashion, and
&ldquo;sassiety,&rdquo; that in that life thou <i>wert</i> a
million years ago, and in it thou wilt be a million <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>years
hence, ever going on in all forms, often enough in rivers, rock,
and trees, and yet canst not realise with a sense of awe that
there are in these forms, passing to others&mdash;ever, ever
on&mdash;myriads of men and women, or at least their
<i>life</i>&mdash;<i>how</i> we know not, as <i>what</i> we know
not&mdash;only this, that the Will or creative force of the
Creator or Creating is in it all.&nbsp; This was the serious yet
unconscious inspiration of my young life in those days, in even
more elaborate or artistic form, which all went very well hand in
hand with the Euclid and Homer or Demosthenes and Livy with which
my tutor Mr. Schenk (pronounce <i>Sk&aacute;nk</i>) was coaching
me.</p>
<p>My reading may seem to the reader to have been more limited
than it was, because I have not mentioned the historians,
essayists, or belletrists whose works are read more or less by
&ldquo;almost everybody.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is hardly worth while to
say, what must be of course surmised, that Sterne, Addison,
Goldsmith, Johnson, Swift, and Macaulay&mdash;in fine, the
leading English classics&mdash;were really well read by me, my
ambition being not to be ignorant of anything which a literary
man should know.&nbsp; Macaulay was then new, and I devoured not
only his works, but a vast amount by him suggested.&nbsp; I
realised at an early age that there was a certain cycle of
knowledge common to all really cultivated minds, and this I was
determined to master.&nbsp; I had, however, little indeed of the
vanity of erudition, having been deeply convinced and constantly
depressed or shamed by the reflection that it was all worse than
useless, and injurious to making my way in life.&nbsp; When I
heard that Professor Dodd had said that at seventeen there were
not ten men in America who had read so much, while Professor
Joseph Henry often used words to this effect, and stern James
Alexander in his lectures would make deeply learned allusions
intended for me alone&mdash;as, for instance, to Kant&rsquo;s
&ldquo;&AElig;sthetik&rdquo;&mdash;I was anything but elated or
vain in consequence.&nbsp; I had read in <i>Sartor Resartus</i>,
&ldquo;If a man reads, shall he not be learned?&rdquo; and I knew
too well that reading was with me an unprofitable, perhaps
pitiable, <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>incurable mania-amusement, which
might ruin me for life, and which, as it was, was a daily source
of apprehension between me and my good true friends, who feared
wisely for my future.</p>
<p>I absolutely made James Alexander smile for once in his
life&mdash;&rsquo;twas sunshine on the grim Tarpeian rock.&nbsp;
I had bought me a nice English large type Juvenal, and written on
the outside in quaint Elizabethan character form&mdash;I forget
now the name of the author&mdash;the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ay, Juvenall, thy jerking hande is good,<br
/>
Not gently laying on, but bringing bloude.<br />
Oh, suffer me amonge so manye men<br />
To treade aright the traces of thy penne,<br />
And light my lamp at thy eternal flame!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We students in the Latin class had left our books on a table,
when I saw grim and dour James Alexander pick up my copy, read
the inscription, when looking up at me he smiled; it was a kind
of poetry which pleased him.</p>
<p>I remember, too, how one day, when in Professor Dodd&rsquo;s
class of mathematics, I, instead of attending to the lecture,
read surreptitiously Cardanus <i>de Subtilitate</i> in an old
vellum binding, and carelessly laid it on the table afterwards,
where Professor Dodd found it, and directed at me one of his
half-laughing Mephistophelian glances.&nbsp; Reading of novels in
lectures was not unknown; but for Dodd to find anything so
caviare-like as Cardanus among our books was unusual.&nbsp;
George Boker remarked once, that while Professor Dodd was a
Greek, Professor James Alexander was an old Roman, which was
indeed a good summary of the two.</p>
<p>I have and always had a bad memory, but I continued to retain
what I read by repetition or reviewing and by <i>collocation</i>,
which is a marvellous aid in retaining images.&nbsp; For, in the
first place, I read entirely by <span
class="smcap">groups</span>; and if I, for instance, attacked
Blair&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhetoric,&rdquo; Longinus and Burke Promptly
followed; and if I perused &ldquo;Rambles in the Footsteps of Don
Quixote,&rdquo; I at once, on principle, followed it up <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>with
&ldquo;Spain in 1830,&rdquo; and a careful study of Ford&rsquo;s
Guide-Book for Spain, and perhaps a score of similar books, till
I had got Spain well into me.&nbsp; And as I have found by years
of observation and much research, having written a book on
Education partly based on this principle, ten books on any
subject read together, profit more than a hundred at
intervals.&nbsp; And I may here add, that if this record of what
I read be dull, it is still that of my real youthful life, giving
the clue to my mind as it was formed.&nbsp; Books in those days
were the only events of my life.</p>
<p>Long before I went to college I had an attack of Irish
antiquities, which I relieved by reading O&rsquo;Brien,
Vallancey, the more sensible Petrie, and O&rsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s
Irish grammar, aided by old Annie Mooney, who always remained by
us.&nbsp; In after years I discovered an Ogham inscription and
the famed Ogham tongue, or <i>Shelta</i>, &ldquo;the lost
language of the bards,&rdquo; according to Kuno Meyer and John
Sampson.</p>
<p>During my first half-year a college magazine was published,
and I, a Freshman, was requested to contribute to the first
number.&nbsp; I sent in an article on the history of English
poetry.&nbsp; Before I wrote it, the great man among the senior
students asked leave to be allowed to write it with me.&nbsp; I
did not quite like the idea, but reflecting that the association
would give me a certain prestige, I accepted his aid.&nbsp; So it
appeared; but it was regarded as mine.&nbsp; Professor Dodd said
something to me about the inexpediency of so young a person
appearing in print.&nbsp; I could have told him that I had
already published several poems, &amp;c., in Philadelphian
newspapers, but reflecting that it was not kind to have the
better of him, I said nothing.&nbsp; From that time I published
something in every number.&nbsp; My second article was an essay
on Spinoza, and I still think it was rather good for a boy of
sixteen.</p>
<p>There was the College and also a Society library, out of which
I picked a great deal of good reading.&nbsp; One day I asked
Professor John MacLean, the college librarian, for the <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>works
of Condorcet.&nbsp; His reply was, &ldquo;Vile book! vile book!
can&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, I found in the Society
library Urquhart&rsquo;s translation of &ldquo;Rabelais,&rdquo;
which I read, I daresay, as often as any mortal ever did.&nbsp;
And here I have a word to say to the wretched idiots who regard
&ldquo;the book called Rabelais&rdquo; as &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;
and unfit for youth.&nbsp; Many times did I try to induce my
young friends to read &ldquo;Rabelais,&rdquo; and some actually
mastered the story of the goose as a <i>torche-cul</i>, and
perhaps two or three chapters more; but as for reading through or
enjoying it, &ldquo;that was not in their minds.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
complained, or at least showed, that they &ldquo;did not
understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to them an aggravating farrago
of filth and oddity, under which they suspected some formal
allegory or meaning which had perished, or was
impenetrable.&nbsp; Learn this, ye prigs of morality, that no
work of genius ever yet demoralised a dolt or ignoramus.&nbsp;
Even the Old Testament, with all its stores of the
&ldquo;shocking,&rdquo; really does very little harm.&nbsp; It
requires <i>mind for mind</i> in reading, and vice becomes
unattractive even to the vicious when they cannot understand
it.&nbsp; I did understand Rabelais, and the <i>Moyen de
Parvenir</i>, and the <i>Cymbalum Mundi</i>, and Boccaccio (I
owned these books), and laughed over them, yet was withal as
pure-minded a youth as could well be imagined without being a
simpleton.&nbsp; For, with all such reading, I best loved such a
book as Bromley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sabbath of Rest,&rdquo; or sweet,
strange works of ancient Mysticism, which bore the soul away to
the stars or into Nature.&nbsp; Such a combination is perfectly
possible when there is no stain of dishonesty or vulgarity in the
character, and I had escaped such influences easily enough.</p>
<p>A droll event took place in the spring.&nbsp; It had been
usual once a year&mdash;I forgot on what occasion&mdash;to give
to all the classes a holiday.&nbsp; This year it was abolished,
and the Sophomore, junior, and senior classes quietly
acquiesced.&nbsp; But we, the Freshmen, albeit we had never been
there before, rebelled at such infringement of &ldquo;our
rights,&rdquo; and absented ourselves from recitation.&nbsp; I
confess that I was a leader in the movement, <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>because I
sincerely believed it to be a sin to &ldquo;remove old
landmarks,&rdquo; and that the students required more rest and
holidays than were allowed them; in which I was absolutely in the
right, for our whole life, except Saturday afternoons, was
&ldquo;one demnition grind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The feeling which was excited by this &ldquo;Freshman&rsquo;s
rebellion&rdquo; was one of utter amazement, or awful
astonishment tempered with laughter, not unmingled with
respect.&nbsp; It was the terrier flying at the lion, when the
great mastiff, and bloodhound, and Danish dog had quietly slunk
aside.&nbsp; There were in the class beside myself several youths
of marked character, and collectively we had already made an
impression, to which my intimacy with George Boker, and Professor
Dodd, and the very <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the seniors, added not
a little force.&nbsp; We were <i>mysterious</i>.&nbsp; Hitherto a
Freshman had been the greenest of the green, a creature created
for ridicule, a sort of &ldquo;leathery fox&rdquo; or mere tyro
(<i>ty</i>&mdash;not a ty-pographical error&mdash;<i>pace</i> my
kind and courteous reviewer in the <i>Saturday</i>)&mdash;and
here were Freshmen of a new kind rising in dignity above all
others.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of a merry tale.&nbsp; It was usual for
Freshmen to learn to smoke for the first time after coming to
college, and for more advanced students to go to their rooms, or
find them in others, and smoke them sick or into
retreating.&nbsp; I, however, found a source of joy in this, that
I could now sit almost from morning till night, and very often on
to three in the morning, smoking all the time, being deeply
learned in Varinas, Kanaster, and the like; for I smoked nothing
but real Holland tobacco, while I could buy it.&nbsp; A party of
Sophomores informed George Boker that they intended to smoke me
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smoke <i>him</i> out!&rdquo; quoth George;
&ldquo;why, he&rsquo;d smoke the whole of you dumb and
blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, it came to pass that one evening
several of them tried it on; and verily they might as well have
tried it on to Niklas Henkerwyssel, who, as the legend goes, sold
his soul to the devil for the ability to smoke all the time, to
whom my <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>father had once compared me.&nbsp; So
the cigars and tobacco were burned, and I liked it
extremely.&nbsp; Denser grew the smoke, and the windows were
closed, to which I cheerfully assented, for I liked to have it
thick; and still more smoke and more, and the young gentlemen who
had come to smother me grew pale, even as the Porcupines grew
pale when they tried to burn out the great Indian sorcerer, who
burned <i>them</i>!&nbsp; But I, who was beginning to enjoy
myself amazingly in such congenial society, only filled
Boker&rsquo;s great meerschaum with Latakia, and puffed
away.&nbsp; One by one the visitors also &ldquo;puffed
away,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, vanished through the door into the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I open the window?&rdquo; asked George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on my account,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
rather enjoy it as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to believe,&rdquo; replied my friend,
&ldquo;that you would like it in Dante&rsquo;s hell of
clouds.&nbsp; Do you know what those men came here for?&nbsp; It
was <i>to smoke you out</i>.&nbsp; And you smoked them out, and
never knew it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was perfectly true.&nbsp; As
for smoking, my only trouble was to be able to buy cigars and
tobacco.&nbsp; These were incredibly cheap in those days, and I
always dressed very respectably, but my smoking always cost me
more than my clothing.</p>
<p>When we Freshmen had rebelled, we were punished by being
rusticated or sent into the country to board.&nbsp; I went to
Professor Dodd to receive my sentence, and in a grave voice, in
which was a faint ring as of irony, and with the lurking devil
which always played in his great marvellous mysterious black
eyes, he said, &ldquo;If you were any other student, I would not
send you to the city, and so reward your rebellion with a
holiday.&nbsp; But as I know perfectly well that you will go into
the Philadelphia Library, and never stop reading till it is time
to return, I will send you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My parents were then absent with my younger sisters in New
England, but I had unlimited credit at Congress Hall Hotel, which
was kept by a Mr. John Sturdevant, and where <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>I was greatly
respected as the son of the owner of the property.&nbsp; So I
went there, and fared well, and, as Professor Dodd prophesied,
read all the time.&nbsp; One night I went into an auction of
delightful old books.&nbsp; My money had run low; there only
remained to me one dollar and a half.</p>
<p>Now, of all books on earth, what I most yearned for in those
days were the works of Jacob Behmen.&nbsp; And the auctioneer put
up a copy containing &ldquo;The Aurora or Morning
Rednesse,&rdquo; English version (<i>circa</i> 1636), and I
bid.&nbsp; One dollar&mdash;one dollar ten
cents&mdash;twenty&mdash;twenty-five; my heart palpitated, and I
half fainted for fear lest I should be outbid, when at the very
last I got it with my last penny.</p>
<p>The black eyes of Professor Dodd twinkled more elfishly than
ever when I exhibited to him my glorious treasure.&nbsp; He
evidently thought that my exile had been to me anything but a
punishment, and he was right.&nbsp; For a copy of
<i>Anthroposophos Theomagicus</i> or the works of Robert Fludd I
would have got up another rebellion.</p>
<p>It was quite against the college regulations for students to
live in the town, but as I never touched a card, was totally
abstemious and &ldquo;moral,&rdquo; and moreover in rather
delicate health, I was passed over as an odd exception.&nbsp;
Once or twice it was proposed to bring me in, but Professor Dodd
interfered and saved me.&nbsp; While in Princeton for more than
four years, I never once touched a drop of anything stronger than
coffee, which was a great pity!&nbsp; Exercise was not in those
days encouraged in any way whatever&mdash;in fact, playing
billiards and ten-pins was liable to be punished by expulsion;
there was no gymnasium, no boating, and all physical games and
manly exercises were sternly discouraged as leading to sin.&nbsp;
Now, if I had drunk a pint of bitter ale every day, and played
cricket or &ldquo;gymnased,&rdquo; or rowed for two hours, it
would have saved me much suffering, and to a great degree have
relieved me from reading, romancing, reflecting, and smoking, all
of which I carried to great excess, having an inborn impulse to
be always doing something.&nbsp; That I did not grapple with <!--
page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>life as a real thing, or with prosaic college studies or
society, was, I can now see, a <i>disease</i>, for which, as my
peculiar tastes had come upon me from nervous and Unitarian and
Alcottian evil influences, I was not altogether
responsible.&nbsp; I was a precocious boy, and I had fully
developed extraordinary influences, which, like the seed of
Scripture, had in my case fallen on more than fertile ground; it
was like the soil of the Margariten Island, by Budapest, which is
so permeated by hot springs in a rich soil that everything comes
to maturity there in one-third of the time which it does
elsewhere.&nbsp; I was the last child on earth who should ever
have fallen into Alcott&rsquo;s hands, or listened to Dr.
Channing or Furness, or have been interested in anything
&ldquo;ideal&rdquo;; but fate willed that I should drink the
elfin goblet to the dregs.</p>
<p>George H. Boker had a great influence on me.&nbsp; We were in
a way connected, for my uncle Amos had married his aunt, and my
cousin, Benjamin Godfrey, his cousin.&nbsp; He was exactly six
feet high, with the form of an Apollo, and a head which was the
very counterpart of the bust of Byron.&nbsp; A few years later N.
P. Willis described him in the <i>Home Journal</i> as the
handsomest man in America.&nbsp; He had been from boyhood as
precociously a man of the world as I was the opposite.&nbsp; He
was <i>par &eacute;minence</i> the poet of our college, and in a
quiet, gentlemanly way its &ldquo;swell.&rdquo;&nbsp; I passed a
great deal of my time in his rooms reading Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Byron, the last named being his ideal.&nbsp; He ridiculed the
Lakers, whom I loved; and when Southey&rsquo;s last poem,
&ldquo;On Gooseberry Pie,&rdquo; appeared, he declared that the
poor old man was in his dotage, to which I assented with sorrow
in my heart.&nbsp; Though only one year older than I, yet, as a
<i>Junior</i>, and from his superior knowledge of life, I
regarded him as being about thirty.&nbsp; He was quite familiar,
in a refined and gentlemanly way, with all the dissipation of
Philadelphia and New York; nor was the small circle of his
friends, with whom I habitually associated, much behind him in
this respect.&nbsp; Even during this Junior year he was offered
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>the post of secretary to our Ambassador at Vienna.&nbsp;
From him and the others I acquired a second-hand knowledge of
life, which was sufficient to keep me from being regarded as a
duffer or utterly &ldquo;green,&rdquo; though in all such
&ldquo;life&rdquo; I was practically as innocent as a young
nun.&nbsp; Now, whatever I heard, as well as read, I always
turned over and over in my mind, thoroughly digesting it to a
most exceptional degree.&nbsp; So that I was somewhat like the
young lady of whom I heard in Vienna in after years.&nbsp; She
was brought up in the utmost moral and strict seclusion, but she
found in her room an aperture through which she could witness all
that took place in the neighbouring room of a <i>maison de
passe</i>; but being a great philosopher, she in time regarded it
all as the &ldquo;butterfly passing show&rdquo; of a theatre, the
mere idle play of foolish mortal passions.</p>
<p>Even before I began my Freshman year there came into my life a
slight but new and valuable influence.&nbsp; Professor Dodd, when
I arrived, had just begun his course of lectures on
architecture.&nbsp; To my great astonishment, but not at all to
that of George Boker, I was invited to attend the course, Boker
remarking dryly that he had no doubt that Dodd thanked God for
having at last got an auditor who would appreciate him.&nbsp;
Which I certainly did.&nbsp; I in after years listened to the
great Thiersch, who trained Heine to art, and of whom I was a
special <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, and many great teachers,
but I never listened to any one like Albert Dodd.&nbsp; It was
not with him the mere description of styles and dates; it was a
deep and truly &aelig;sthetic feeling that every phase of
architecture mirrors and reciprocally forms its age, and breathes
its life and poetry and religion, which characterised all that he
said.&nbsp; It was in nothing like the subjective rhapsodies of
Ruskin, which bloomed out eight years later, but rather in the
spirit of Vischer and Taine, which J. A. Symonds has so
beautifully and clearly set forth in his Essays <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a><!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>&mdash;that
is, the spirit of historical development.&nbsp; Here my German
philosophy enabled me to grasp a subtle and delicate spirit of
beauty, which passed, I fear, over the heads of the rest of the
youthful audience.&nbsp; His ideas of the correspondence of
Egyptian architecture to the stupendous massiveness of Pantheism
and the appalling grandeur of its ideas, were clear enough to me,
who had copied Hermes Trismegistus and read with deepest feeling
the Orphic and Chaldean oracles.&nbsp; The ideas had not only
been long familiar to me, but formed my very life and the subject
of the most passionate study.&nbsp; To hear them clearly
expressed with rare beauty, in the deep, strange voice of the
professor, was joy beyond belief.&nbsp; And as it would not be in
human nature for a lecturer not to note an admiring auditor, it
happened often enough that something was often introduced for my
special appreciation.</p>
<p>For I may here note&mdash;and it was a very natural
thing&mdash;that just as Gypsy musicians always select in the
audience some one who seems to be most appreciative, at whom they
play (they call it <i>d&eacute; o k&#257;n</i>), so Professors
Dodd and James Alexander afterwards, in their &aelig;sthetic, or
more erudite disquisitions, rarely failed to fiddle at
me&mdash;Dodd looking right in my eyes, and Alexander at the
ceiling, ending, however, with a very brief glance, as if for
conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; I feel proud of this, and it
affects me more now than it did then, when it produced no effect
of vanity, and seemed to me to be perfectly natural.</p>
<p>I heard certain mutterings and hoots among the students as I
went out of the lecture-room, but did not know what it
meant.&nbsp; George Boker informed me afterwards that there had
been great indignation expressed that &ldquo;a green ignorant
Freshman&rdquo; had dared to intrude, as I had done, among his
intellectual superiors and betters, but that he had at once
explained <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>that I was a great friend of
Professor Dodd, and a kind of marvellous <i>rara avis</i>, not to
be classed with common little Freshmen; so that in future I was
allowed to go my way in peace.</p>
<p>A man of culture who had known Coleridge well, declared that
as a conversationalist on varied topics Professor Albert Dodd was
his superior.&nbsp; When in the pulpit, or in the lengthened
&ldquo;addresses&rdquo; of lecturing, there was a marvellous
fascination in his voice&mdash;an Italian witch, or red Indian,
or a gypsy would have at once recognised in him a sorcerer.&nbsp;
Yet his manner was subdued, his voice monotonous, never loud, a
running stream without babbling stones or rapids; but when it
came to a climax cataract he cleared it with grandeur, leaving a
stupendous impression.&nbsp; In the ordinary monotony of that
deep voice there was soon felt an indescribable charm.&nbsp; In
saying this I only repeat what I have heard in more or less
different phrase from others.&nbsp; There was always in his eyes
(and in this as in other points he resembled Emerson) a strange
indefinable suspicion of a smile, though he, like the Sage of
Concord, rarely laughed.&nbsp; Owing to these black eyes, and his
sallow complexion, his sobriquet among the students was
&ldquo;the royal Bengal tiger.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not unlike
Emerson as a lecturer.&nbsp; I heard the latter deliver his great
course of lectures in London in 1848&mdash;including the famous
one on Napoleon&mdash;but he had not to the same perfection the
music of the voice, nor the indefinable mysterious charm which
characterised the style of Professor Dodd, who played with
emotion as if while feeling he was ever superior to it.&nbsp; He
was a great actor, who had gone far beyond acting or art.</p>
<p>Owing, I suppose, to business losses, my father and family
lived for two years either at Congress Hall Hotel or <i>en
pension</i>.&nbsp; I spent my first vacation at the former
place.&nbsp; There lived in the house a Colonel John Du Solle,
the editor of a newspaper.&nbsp; He was a good-natured, rather
dissipated man, who kept horses and had a fancy for me, and took
me out <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>&ldquo;on drives,&rdquo; and once
introduced me in the street to a great actress, Susan Cushman, <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a> and very often to theatres and
coffee-houses and reporters, and printed several of my
lucubrations.&nbsp; Du Solle was in after years secretary to P.
T. Barnum, whom I also knew well.&nbsp; He was kind to me, and I
owe him this friendly mention.&nbsp; Some people thought him a
rather dangerous companion for youth, but I was never taken by
him into bad company or places, nor did I ever hear from him a
word of which my parents would have disapproved.&nbsp; But I
really believe that I could at that time, or any other, have kept
company with the devil and not been much harmed: it was not in
me.&nbsp; Edgar A. Poe was often in Du Solle&rsquo;s office and
at Congress Hall.</p>
<p>In the summer we all went to Stonington, Connecticut, where we
lived at a hotel called the Wadawanuc House.&nbsp; There I went
out sailing&mdash;once on a clam-bake excursion in a yacht owned
by Captain Nat. Palmer, who had discovered Palmer&rsquo;s
Land&mdash;and sailed far and wide.&nbsp; That summer I also saw
on his own deck the original old Vanderbilt himself, who was then
the captain of a Sound steamboat; and I bathed every day in
salt-water, and fished from the wharf, and smoked a great deal,
and read French books; and after a while we went into
Massachusetts and visited the dear old villages and Boston, and
so on, till I had to return to Princeton.&nbsp; Soon after my
father took another house in Walnut Street, the next door above
the one where we had lived.&nbsp; This one was rather better, for
though it had less garden, it had larger back-buildings.</p>
<p><i>Bon an</i>, <i>mal an</i>, the time passed away at
Princeton for four years.&nbsp; I was often very ill.&nbsp; In
the last year the physician <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>who tested
my lungs declared they were unsound in two places; and about this
time I was believed to have contracted an incurable stoop in the
shoulders.&nbsp; One day I resolved that from <i>that minute</i>
I would always hold myself straight upright; and I did so, and in
the course of time became as straight as an arrow, and have
continued so, I believe, ever since.</p>
<p>I discovered vast treasures of strange reading in the library
of the Princeton Theological College.&nbsp; There was in one
corner in a waste-room at least two cart-loads of old books in a
cobwebbed dusty pile.&nbsp; Out of that pile I raked the
<i>thirteenth</i> known copy of Blind Harry&rsquo;s famed poem, a
black-letter Euphues Lely, an <i>Erra Pater</i> (a very
weak-minded friend <i>actually shamed</i> me out of making a copy
of this great curiosity, telling me it was silly and childish of
me to be so pleased with old trash), and many more marvels, which
were so little esteemed in Princeton, that one of the professors,
seeing me daft with delight over my finds, told me I was quite
welcome to keep them all; but I, who better knew their
<i>great</i> value, would not avail myself of the offer,
reflecting that a time would come when these treasures would be
properly valued.&nbsp; God knows it was a <i>terrible</i>
temptation to me, and such as I hope I may never have
again&mdash;<i>ne inducas nos in temptationem</i>!</p>
<p>The time for my graduation was at hand.&nbsp; I had profited
very much in the last year by the teaching and friendly counsel
of Professor Joseph Henry, whose lectures on philosophy I
diligently attended; also those on geology, chemistry and botany
by Professor Torrey, and by the company of Professor
Topping.&nbsp; I stood very high in Latin, and perhaps first in
English branches.&nbsp; Yet, because I had fallen utterly short
in mathematics, I was rated the lowest but one in the
class&mdash;or, honestly speaking, the very last, for the one
below me was an utterly reckless youth, who could hardly be said
to have studied or graduated at all.&nbsp; There were two honours
usually awarded for proficiency in study.&nbsp; One was the First
Honour, <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and he who received it delivered the
Valedictory Oration; the second was the Poem; and by an excess of
kindness and justice for which I can never feel too grateful, and
which was really an extraordinary stretch of their power under
the circumstances, the Poem was awarded to me!</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed at the honour, but bitterly mortified and
cut to my heart to think how little I had deserved it; for I had
never done a thing save read and study that which pleased me and
was <i>easy</i>.&nbsp; I wrote the poem (and I still think it was
a good one, for I put all my soul into it), and sent it in to the
Faculty, with a letter stating that I was deeply grateful for
their extreme kindness, but that, feeling I had not deserved it,
I must decline the honour.&nbsp; But I sent them my MS. as a
proof that I did not do so because I felt myself incapable, and
because I wished to give them some evidence that they had not
erred in regarding me as a poet.</p>
<p>Very foolish and boyish, the reader may say, and yet I never
regretted it.&nbsp; The Faculty were not to blame for the system
pursued, and they did their utmost in every way for four years to
make it easy and happy for one of the laziest and most
objectionable students whom they had ever had.&nbsp; I have never
been really able to decide whether I was right or wrong.&nbsp; At
liberal Cambridge, Massachusetts, neither I nor the professors
would ever have discovered a flaw in my industry.&nbsp; At the
closely cramped, orthodox, hide-bound, mathematical Princeton,
every weakness in me seemed to be developed.&nbsp; Thirty years
later I read in the <i>Nassau Monthly</i>, which I had once
edited, that if Boker and I and a few others had become known in
literature, we had done so <i>in spite of</i> our education
there.&nbsp; I do not know who wrote it; whoever he was, I am
much obliged to him for a very comforting word.&nbsp; For,
discipline apart, it was literally &ldquo;in spite of our
education&rdquo; that we learned anything worth knowing at
Princeton&mdash;as it then was.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>From this point a new phase of life begins.&nbsp; Prominent
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>in it and as its moving power was the great kindness of
my father.&nbsp; That I had graduated at all under any conditions
was gratifying, and so was the fact that it was not in reality
without the so-called Second Honour, despite my low grade.&nbsp;
And the pitiable condition of my health was considered.&nbsp;
During the last year I had taken lessons in dancing and fencing,
which helped me a little, and I looked as if I might become
strong with a change of life.&nbsp; So my father took my mother
and me on a grand excursion.&nbsp; We went to Stonington, New
York, and Saratoga, where I attended a ball&mdash;my
first&mdash;and then on to Niagara.&nbsp; On the way we stopped
at Auburn, where there was a great State-prison, which I visited
alone.&nbsp; There was among its attractions a noted murderer
under sentence of death.&nbsp; There were two or three ladies and
gentlemen who were shown by the warder with me over the
building.&nbsp; He expressed some apprehension as to showing us
the murderer, for he was a very desperate character.&nbsp; We
entered a large room, and I saw a really gentlemanly-looking man
heavily ironed, who was reading a newspaper.&nbsp; While the
others conversed with him, I endeavoured to make unobserved a
sketch of his face.&nbsp; The warder noticing this, called me to
the front to make it boldly, and the prisoner, smiling, told me
to go on with it; which I did, and that not so badly&mdash;at
least, the sitter approved of it.</p>
<p>So we went up the beautiful Hudson, which far surpasses the
Rhine, and yields the palm only to the Danube, stopping at
Poughkeepsie and Albany, and so on to Niagara Falls.&nbsp; On the
way we passed through a burning forest.&nbsp; My awe at this
wonderful sight amused some one present to whom it was a familiar
thing.&nbsp; Which reminds me that about the time when I first
went to college, but while staying at Congress Hall, I there met
a youth from Alabama or Mississippi, who was on his way to
Princeton to join our ranks.&nbsp; To him I of course showed
every attention, and by way of promoting his happiness took him
to the top of the belfry of the State House, whence there is a
fine view.&nbsp; While there I casually <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>remarked
what a number of ships there were in the river, whereupon he
eagerly cried, &ldquo;Oh, show me one!&nbsp; I never saw a ship
in all my life!&rdquo;&nbsp; I gazed at him in utter
astonishment, as if I would say, &ldquo;What manner of man art
thou?&rdquo; and then recalling myself, said, &ldquo;Well, we are
just equal, for you never saw a ship, and I never saw a
<i>cotton-field</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man smiled
incredulously, and replied, &ldquo;Now I know that you are trying
to humbug me, for how <i>could</i> you grow up without ever
seeing cotton-fields?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We arrived at Niagara about noon, and I at once went to see
the Falls.&nbsp; There was a very respectable-looking old
gentleman, evidently from the far South, with two young ladies,
one a great beauty, advancing just before.&nbsp; I heard him say,
&ldquo;Now, keep your eyes closed, or look down till you can have
a full view.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did the same, and when he cried
&ldquo;Look up!&rdquo; did so.&nbsp; It was one of the great
instants of my life.</p>
<p>I know not how it was, but that first glance suggested to me
something <i>chivalric</i>.&nbsp; It may have been from
Byron&rsquo;s simile of the tail of the white horse and the
cataract, and the snow-white steed of that incarnation of
nobility, Crescentius, and there rang in my memory a mystical
verse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My eye bears a glance like the gleam of a
lance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I hear the waters dash and dance;<br />
And I smile with glee, for I love to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sight of anything that&rsquo;s free!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it was a mingled sense of nobility, and above all of
<i>freedom</i>, which impressed me in that roaring mist of
waters, in the wild river leaping as in reckless sport over the
vast broad precipice.&nbsp; It is usual, especially for those who
have no gift of description, to say that Niagara is
&ldquo;utterly indescribable,&rdquo; and the Visitors&rsquo; Book
has this opinion repeated by the American Philistine on every
page.&nbsp; But that is because those who say so have no proper
comprehension of facts stated, no poetic faculty, and no
imagination.&nbsp; Of course no mere description, however
perfect, would give the same conception of even a pen or a button
as would the <i>sight</i> thereof; <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>but it is
absurd and illogical to speak as if this were <i>peculiar</i> to
a great thing alone.&nbsp; For my part, I believe that the mere
description to a <i>poet</i>, or to one who has dwelt by wood and
wold and steeped his soul in Nature, of a tremendous cataract a
mile in breadth and two hundred feet high, cleft by a wooded
island, and rushing onward below in awful rocky rapids with a
mighty roar, would, could, or should convey a very good idea of
the great sight.&nbsp; For I found in after years, when I came to
see Venice and the temples on the Nile, that they were
picturesquely or practically precisely what I had expected to
see, not one shade or <i>nuance</i> of an expression more or
less.&nbsp; As regards Rome and all Gothic cathedrals, I had been
assured so often, or so generally, by all &ldquo;intelligent
tourists,&rdquo; that they were all wretched rubbish, that I was
amazed to find them so beautiful.&nbsp; And so much as to
anticipations of Niagara, which I have thrice visited, and the
constant assertion by cads unutterable that it is
&ldquo;indescribable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While at Niagara for three days, I walked about a great deal
with a young lady whose acquaintance we had made at the
hotel.&nbsp; As she was, I verily believe, the very first, not a
relative, with whom I had ever taken a walk, or, I may almost
say, formed an acquaintance, it constituted an event in my life
equal to Niagara itself in importance.&nbsp; I was at this time
just twenty-one, and certain I am that among twenty-one thousand
college graduates of my age in America, of the same condition of
life, there was not another so inexperienced in worldly ways, or
so far behind his age, or so &ldquo;docile unto
discipline.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was, in fact, morally where most boys
in the United States are at twelve or thirteen; which is a very
great mistake where there is a fixed determination that the youth
shall make his own way in life.&nbsp; We cannot have boys good
little angels at home and devils in business
abroad.&mdash;<i>Horum utrum magis velim</i>, <i>mihi incertum

<p>After our return to Philadelphia something of great importance
to me began to be discussed.&nbsp; My cousin Samuel Godfrey, who
was a few years older than I, finding himself threatened with
consumption, of which all his family died, resolved to go to
Marseilles on a voyage, and persuaded my father to let me
accompany him.&nbsp; At this time I had, as indeed for many years
before, such a desire to visit Europe that I might almost have
died of it.&nbsp; So it was at last determined that I should go
with &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; and after all due preparations and
packing, I bade farewell to mother and Henry and the dear little
twin sisters, and youngest Emily, our pet, and went with my
father to New York, where I was the guest for a few days of my
cousin, Mrs. Caroline Wight, whom the reader may recall as the
one who used to correct my French exercises in Dedham.</p>
<p>We were to sail in a packet or ship for Marseilles.&nbsp; My
<!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>father saw me off.&nbsp; He was wont to say in after
years, that as I stood on the deck at the last moment and looked
affectionately at him, there was in my eyes an expression of
innocence or goodness and gentleness which he never saw
again.&nbsp; Which was, I am sure, very true; the great pity
being that that look had not utterly disappeared years
before.&nbsp; If it only <i>had</i> vanished with boyhood, as it
ought to have done, my father would have been spared much
sorrow.</p>
<p>At this time I was a trifle over six feet two in height, and
had then and for some time after so fair a red and white
complexion, that the young ladies in Philadelphia four years
later teased me by spreading the report that I used rouge and
white paint!&nbsp; I was not as yet &ldquo;filled out,&rdquo; but
held myself straightly, and was fairly proportioned.&nbsp; I wore
a cap <i>a l&rsquo;&eacute;tudiant</i>, very much over my left
ear, and had very long, soft, straight, dark-brown hair; my dream
and ideal being the German student.&nbsp; I was extremely shy of
strangers, but when once acquainted soon became very friendly,
and in most cases made a favourable impression.&nbsp; I was
&ldquo;neat and very clean-looking,&rdquo; as a lady described
me, for the daily bath or sponge was universal in Philadelphia
long ere it was even in England, and many a time when travelling
soon after, I went without a meal in order to have my tub, when
time did not permit of both.&nbsp; I was very sensitive, and my
feelings were far too easily pained; on the other hand, I had no
trace of the common New England youth&rsquo;s vulgar failing of
nagging, teasing, or vexing others under colour of being
&ldquo;funny&rdquo; or &ldquo;cute.&rdquo;&nbsp; A very striking,
and, all things considered, a remarkable characteristic was that
I <i>hated</i>, as I still do, with all my soul, gossip about
other people and their affairs; never read even a card not meant
for my eyes, and detested curiosity, prying, and inquisitiveness
as I did the devil.&nbsp; I owe a great development of this to a
curious incident.&nbsp; It must have been about the time when I
first went to college, that I met at Cape May a naval officer,
who roomed with me in a cottage, a farm-house near a hotel, and
whom I greatly admired <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>as a man of
the world and a model of good manners.&nbsp; To him one day I
communicated some gossip about somebody, when he abruptly cut me
short, and when I would go on informed me that he never listened
to such talk.&nbsp; This made a very deep impression on me, which
never disappeared; nay, it grew with my growth and strengthened
with my strength.&nbsp; Now the New England people, especially
Bostonians, are inordinately given to knowing everything about
everybody, and to &ldquo;tittle-tattle,&rdquo; while the
Southerners are comparatively free from it and very
incurious.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the students at Princeton were of
the first families in the South, and there my indifference to
what did not personally concern one was regarded as a
virtue.&nbsp; But there is a spot in this sun&mdash;that he who
never cares a straw to know about the affairs of other people,
will, not only if he live in Boston, but almost anywhere
else&mdash;Old England not at all excepted&mdash;be forced, in
spite of himself, and though he were as meek and lowly as man may
be, into looking down on and feeling himself superior unto those
people who <i>will</i> read a letter not meant for their eyes, or
eavesdrop, or talk in any way about anybody in a strain to which
they would not have that person listen.&nbsp; Which reminds me
that in after years I got some praise in the newspapers for the
saying that a Yankee&rsquo;s idea of hell was a place where he
must mind his own business.&nbsp; It came about in this
way.&nbsp; In a letter to Charles Astor Bristed I made this
remark, and illustrated it with a picture of Virgil taking a
Yankee attired in a chimney-pot hat and long night-gown into the
Inferno, over whose gate was written&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Badate a vostri affari voi che
intrate!&rdquo;<br />
(Mind your own business ye who enter here!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day soon after my arrival at Princeton, George Boker laid
on the table by me a paper or picture with its face down.&nbsp; I
took no notice of it.&nbsp; After a time he said, &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you look at that picture?&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied
simply, &ldquo;If you wanted me to see it you would have turned
it face up.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>remarked,
&ldquo;I put it there to see whether you would look at it.&nbsp;
I thought you would not.&rdquo;&nbsp; George was a &ldquo;deep,
sagacious file,&rdquo; who studied men like books.</p>
<p>My cousin who accompanied me had as a boy &ldquo;run away and
gone to sea&rdquo; cod-fishing on the Grand Banks.&nbsp; If I had
gone with him it would have done me good.&nbsp; Another cousin,
Benjamin Stimson, did the same; he is the S. often mentioned in
Dana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two Years Before the Mast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dana
and Stimson were friends, and ran away together.&nbsp; It was
quite the rule for all my Yankee cousins to do this, and they all
benefited by it.&nbsp; In consequence of his nautical experience
Sam was soon at home among all sailors, and not having my
scruples as to knowing who was who or their affairs, soon knew
everything that was going on.&nbsp; Our captain was a handsome,
dissipated, and &ldquo;loud&rdquo; young man, with rather more
sail than ballast, but good-natured and obliging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come day, go day,&rdquo; we passed the Gulf Stream and
the Azores, and had long sunny calms, when we could not sail, and
lay about on deck, warm and lazy, and saw the Azores, and so on,
till we were near the Spanish coast.&nbsp; One evening there
clipped right under our lee a fisherman&rsquo;s smack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say, Leland, hail that fellow!&rdquo; said the
captain.&nbsp; So I called in Spanish, &ldquo;Adonde venga
usted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da Algesiras,&rdquo; was the reply, which thrilled out
of my heart the thought that, like the squire in
Chaucer&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He had been at the siege of
Algecir.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I called, in parting, &ldquo;Dios vaya con
usted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam informed me that the manner in which I hailed the
fisherman had made a great impression on the captain, who lauded
me highly.&nbsp; It also made one on me, because it was the first
time I ever spoke to a European <i>in Europe</i>!</p>
<p>Anon we were boarded by an old weather-beaten seadog of a
Spanish pilot, unto whom I felt a great attraction; and greeting
him in Malagan Spanish, such as I had learned from Manuel Gori,
as <i>Hermano</i>! and offering him with ceremonious <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>politeness a good cigar, I also drew his regards; all
Spaniards, as I well knew, being extremely fond, beyond all men
on earth, of intimacy with gentlemen.&nbsp; We were delayed for
two days at Gibraltar.&nbsp; I may here remark, by the way, that
this voyage of our ship is described in a book by Mrs. Fanny
Kemble Butler, entitled &ldquo;A Year of Consolation
Abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was on board, but never spoke to a soul
among the passengers.</p>
<p>I was never acquainted with Mrs. Butler, as I easily might
have been, for we had some very intimate friends in common; but
as a boy I had been &ldquo;frightened of her&rdquo; by certain
anecdotes as to her temper, and perhaps the influence lasted into
later years.&nbsp; I have, however, heard her lecture.&nbsp; She
was a very clever woman, and Mr. Henry James, in <i>Temple
Bar</i> for March, 1893, thus does justice to her conversational
power:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Her talk reflected a thousand vanished and
present things; but there were those of her friends for whom its
value was, almost before any other, documentary.&nbsp; The
generations move so fast and change so much, that Mrs. Kemble
testified even more than she affected to do, which was much, to
ancient manners and a close chapter of history.&nbsp; Her
conversation swarmed with people and with criticism of people,
with the ghosts of a dead society.&nbsp; She had, in two
hemispheres, seen every one and known every one, had assisted at
the social comedy of her age.&nbsp; Her own habits and traditions
were in themselves a survival of an era less democratic and more
mannered.&nbsp; I have no room for enumerations, which, moreover,
would be invidious; but the old London of her talk&mdash;the
direction I liked is best to take&mdash;was, in particular, a
gallery of portraits.&nbsp; She made Count d&rsquo;Orsay
familiar, she made Charles Greville present; I thought it
wonderful that she could be anecdotic about Miss Edgeworth.&nbsp;
She reanimated the old drawing-rooms, relighted the old lamps,
retuned the old pianos.&nbsp; The finest comedy of all, perhaps,
was that of her own generous whimsicalities.&nbsp; She was
superbly willing to amuse, and on any terms; and her temper could
do it as well as her wit.&nbsp; If either of these had failed,
her eccentricities were always there.&nbsp; She had more
&lsquo;habits&rsquo; than most people have room in life for, and
a theory that to a person of her disposition they were as
necessary as the close meshes of a strait-waistcoat.&nbsp; If she
had not lived by rule (on her showing) she would have lived
infallibly by riot.&nbsp; Her rules and her riots, her
reservations and her concessions, <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>all her
luxuriant theory and all her extravagant practice; her drollery,
that mocked at her melancholy; her imagination, that mocked at
her drollery; and her wonderful manners, all her own, that mocked
a little at everything: these were part of the constant freshness
which made those who loved her love her so much.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
my servants can live with me a week, they can live with me for
ever,&rsquo; she often said; &lsquo;but the first week sometimes
kills them.&rsquo;&nbsp; A domestic who had been long in her
service quitted his foreign home the instant he heard of her
death, and, travelling for thirty hours, arrived travel-stained
and breathless, like a messenger in a romantic tale, just in time
to drop a handful of flowers into her grave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There came on board of our boat a fruit-dealer, and the old
pilot, seeing that I was about to invest a <i>real</i> in grapes,
said, &ldquo;Let me buy them for you&rdquo;; which he did,
obtaining half-a-peck of exquisite large grapes of a beautiful
purple colour.</p>
<p>There was a middle-aged lady among the passengers, of whom the
least I can say was, that she had a great many little winning
ways of making herself disagreeable.&nbsp; She imposed
frightfully on me while on board, getting me to mark her trunks
for her, and carry them into the hold, &amp;c. (the sailors
disliked her so much that they refused to touch them), and then
cut me dead when on shore.&nbsp; This ancient horror, seeing me
with so many grapes, and learning the price, concluded that if a
mere boy like me could get so many, she, a lady, could for four
reals lay in a stock which would last for life, more or
less.&nbsp; So she obtained a bushel-basket, expecting to get it
heaped full; but what was her wrath at only getting for her
silver half-dollar just enough to hide the bottom thereof!&nbsp;
Great was her rage, but rage availed her nought.&nbsp; She did
not call old pilots &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; or give them cigars,
or talk Malagano politely.&nbsp; She was not even
&ldquo;half-Spanish,&rdquo; and therefore, as we used to say at
college of certain unpopular people, was &ldquo;a bad
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went on shore on Sunday, which in those days always made
Gibraltar literally like a fancy ball.&nbsp; The first person
whom I met was a pretty young lady in full, antique, rich <!--
page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Castilian costume, followed by a servant bearing her
book of devotion.&nbsp; Seeing my gaze of admiration, she smiled,
at which I bowed, and she returned the salute and went her
way.&nbsp; Such an event had never happened to me before in all
my life.&nbsp; I accepted it philosophically as one of a new
order of things into which I was destined to enter.&nbsp; Then I
saw men from every part of Spain in quaint dresses, Castilians in
cloaks, Andalusians in the jaunty <i>majo</i> rig, Gallegos,
Moors from the Barbary coast, many Greeks, old Jews in
gabardines, Scotch Highland soldiers, and endless
more&mdash;<i>concursus splendidus</i>&mdash;<i>non possum non
mirari</i>.</p>
<p>I felt myself very happy and very much at home in all
this.&nbsp; I strolled about the streets talking Spanish to
everybody.&nbsp; Then I met with a smuggler, who asked me if I
wanted to buy cigars.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; In New York my uncle
George had given me a box of five hundred excellent Havanas, and
these had lasted me exactly twenty days.&nbsp; I had smoked the
last twenty-five on the last day.&nbsp; So I went and bought at a
low enough figure a box of the worst cigars I had ever met
with.&nbsp; But youth can smoke anything&mdash;except deceit.</p>
<p>Entrance to the galleries was strictly forbidden in those
days, but an incorruptible British sergeant, for an incorruptible
dollar or two, showed us over them.&nbsp; There was, too, a
remarkable man, a ship-chandler named Felipe, to whom I was
introduced.&nbsp; Felipe spoke twenty-four languages.&nbsp; He
boarded every ship and knew everybody.&nbsp; Gibraltar was then a
vast head-quarters of social evils, or blessings, and Felipe, who
was a perfect Hercules, mentioned incidentally that he had had a
new <i>maja</i>, or <i>moza</i>, or <i>muger</i>, or <i>puta</i>,
every night for twenty years! which was confirmed by common
report.&nbsp; It was a firm principle with him to always
<i>change</i>.&nbsp; This extraordinary fact made me reflect
deeply on it as a <i>psychological</i> phenomenon.&nbsp; This far
surpassed anything I had ever heard at Princeton.&nbsp; Then this
and that great English dignitary was pointed out to
me&mdash;black eyes ogled me&mdash;everybody <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>was polite,
for I had a touch of the Spanish manner which I had observed in
the ex-Capitan-General and others whom I had known in
Philadelphia; and, in short, I saw more that was picturesque and
congenial in that one day than I had ever beheld in all my life
before.&nbsp; I had got into &ldquo;my plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Gibraltar our ship sailed on to Marseilles.&nbsp; The
coasts were full of old ruins, which I sketched.&nbsp; We lay off
Malaga for a day, but I could not go ashore, much as I longed
to.&nbsp; At Marseilles, Sam and the captain and I went to a very
good hotel.</p>
<p>Now it had happened that on the voyage before a certain French
lady&mdash;the captain said she was a Baroness&mdash;having
fallen in love with the said captain, had secreted herself on
board the vessel, greatly to his horror, and reappeared when out
at sea.&nbsp; Therefore, as soon as we arrived at Marseilles, the
injured husband came raging on board and tried to shoot the
captain, which made a great <i>scandal</i>.&nbsp; And, moved by
this example, the coloured cook of our vessel, who had a wife,
shot the head-waiter on the same day, being also instigated by
jealousy.&nbsp; Sam Godfrey chaffed the captain for setting a bad
moral example to the niggers&mdash;which was all quite a change
from Princeton.&nbsp; Life was beginning to be lively.</p>
<p>There had come over on the vessel with us, in the cabin, a
droll character, an actor in a Philadelphia theatre, who had
promptly found a lodging in a kind of maritime
boarding-house.&nbsp; Getting into some difficulty, as he could
not speak French he came in a great hurry to beg me to go with
him to his <i>pension</i> to act as interpreter, which I
did.&nbsp; I found at once that it was a Spanish house, and the
resort of smugglers.&nbsp; The landlady was a very pretty
black-eyed woman, who played the guitar, and sang Spanish songs,
and brought out Spanish wine, and was marvellously polite to me,
to my astonishment, not unmingled with innocent gratitude.</p>
<p>There I was at home.&nbsp; At Princeton I had learned to play
the guitar, and from Manuel Gori, who had during all his <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>boyhood been familiar with low life and smugglers, I
had learned many songs and some slang.&nbsp; And so, with a crowd
of dark, fierce, astonished faces round me of men eagerly
listening, I sang a smuggler&rsquo;s song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yo que soy contrabandista,<br />
Y campo a me rispeto,<br />
A todos mi desafio,<br />
Quien me compra hilo negro?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay jaleo!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Muchachas jaleo!<br />
Quien me compra hilo negro!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great was the amazement and thundering the applause from my
auditors.&nbsp; Let the reader imagine a nun of fourteen years
asked to sing, and bursting out with &ldquo;Go it while
you&rsquo;re young!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I sang the <i>Tragala</i>,
which coincided with the political views of my friends.&nbsp; But
my grand <i>coup</i> was in reserve.&nbsp; I had learned from
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gypsies in Spain&rdquo; a long string of
Gitano or Gypsy verses, such as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;El eray guillabela,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; El eray obusno;<br />
Que avella romanella,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No avella obusno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud sang the <i>gorgio</i> to his fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus his ditty ran:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Oh, may the Gypsy maiden come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not the Gypsy man!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Coruncho Lopez, gallant lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A smuggling he would ride;<br />
So stole his father&rsquo;s ambling prad,<br />
And therefore to the galleys sad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Coruncho now I guide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a final <i>coup</i>.&nbsp; How the <i>diabolo</i> I,
such an innocent stranger youth, had ever learned Spanish
<i>Gypsy</i>&mdash;the least knowledge of which in Spain implies
unfathomable iniquity <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and fastness&mdash;was beyond all
comprehension.&nbsp; So I departed full of honour amid thunders
of applause.</p>
<p>From the first day our room was the resort of all the American
ship-captains in Marseilles.&nbsp; We kept a kind of social hall
or exchange, with wine and cigars on the side-table, all of which
dropping in and out rather reminded me of Princeton.&nbsp; My
friend the actor had pitched upon a young English Jew, who seemed
to me to be a doubtful character.&nbsp; He sang very well, and
was full of local news and gossip.&nbsp; He, too, was at home
among us.&nbsp; One evening our captain told us how he every day
smuggled ashore fifty cigars in his hat.&nbsp; At hearing this, I
saw a gleam in the eyes of the young man, which was a revelation
to me.&nbsp; When he had gone, I said to the captain, &ldquo;You
had better not smuggle any cigars to-morrow.&nbsp; That fellow is
a spy of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Captain Jack on leaving his ship was accosted by
the <i>douaniers</i>, who politely requested him to take off his
hat.&nbsp; He refused, and was then told that he must go before
the <i>pr&eacute;fet</i>.&nbsp; There the request was
renewed.&nbsp; He complied; but &ldquo;forewarned,
forearmed&rdquo;&mdash;there was nothing in it.</p>
<p>Captain Jack complimented me on my sagacity, and scolded the
actor for making such friends.&nbsp; But he had unconsciously
made me familiar with one compared to whom the spy was a
trifle.&nbsp; I have already fully and very truthfully described
this remarkable man in an article in <i>Temple Bar</i>, but his
proper place is here.&nbsp; He was a little modest-looking
Englishman, who seemed to me rather to look up to the fast young
American captains as types or models of more daring beings.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would tell a mildly-naughty tale as if it were a
wild thing.&nbsp; He consulted with me as to going to Paris and
hearing lectures at the University, his education having been
neglected.&nbsp; He had, I was told, experienced a sad loss,
having just lost his ship on the Guinea coast.&nbsp; One day I
condoled with him, saying that I heard he had been ruined.</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;I
have.&nbsp; Something like this: My mother once had a very pretty
housemaid who disappeared.&nbsp; Some time after I met her
magnificently dressed, and I said, &lsquo;Sally, where do you
live now?&rsquo;&nbsp; She replied, &lsquo;Please, sir, I
don&rsquo;t live anywhere now; I&rsquo;ve been
<i>ruined</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam explained to me that the captain had a keg of gold-dust
and many diamonds, and having wrecked his vessel intentionally,
was going to London to get a heavy insurance.&nbsp; He had been
&ldquo;ruined&rdquo; to his very great advantage.&nbsp; Then Sam
remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the captain.&nbsp; I tell you,
Charley, that man is an old slaver or pirate.&nbsp; See how
I&rsquo;ll draw him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day Sam began to talk.&nbsp; He remarked that
he had been to sea and had some money which he wished to
invest.&nbsp; His health required a warm climate, such as the
African coast.&nbsp; We would both, in fact, like to go into the
Guinea business.&nbsp; [<i>Bozales</i>&mdash;&ldquo;sacks of
charcoal,&rdquo; I remarked in Spanish slaver-slang.]&nbsp; The
captain smiled.&nbsp; He had apparently heard the expression
before.&nbsp; He considered it.&nbsp; He had a great liking for
me, and thought that a trip or two under the black flag would do
me a great deal of good.&nbsp; So he noted down our address, and
promised that as soon as he should get a ship we should hear from
him.</p>
<p>After that the captain, regarding me as enlisted in the
fraternity, and only waiting till &rsquo;twas &ldquo;time for us
to go,&rdquo; had no secrets from me.&nbsp; He was very glad that
I knew Spanish and French, and explained that if I would learn
Coromantee or Ebo, it would aid us immensely in getting
cargoes.&nbsp; By the way, I became very well acquainted in after
years with King George of Bonney, and can remember entertaining
him with a story how a friend of mine once (in Cuba) bought
thirty Ebos, and on entering the barracoon the next morning,
found them all hanging by the necks dead, like a row of possums
in the Philadelphia market&mdash;they having, with magnificent
pluck, and in glorious defiance of Buckra civilisation, resolved
to go back to Africa.&nbsp; I have found other blacks <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>who believed that all good darkies when they die go to
Guinea, and one of these was very touching and strange.&nbsp; He
had been brought as a slave-child to South Carolina, but was
always haunted by the memory of a group of cocoa-palms by a place
where the wild white surf of the ocean bounded up to the
shore&mdash;a rock, sunshine, and sand.&nbsp; There he declared
his soul would go.&nbsp; He was a Voodoo, and a man of marvellous
strange mind.</p>
<p>Day by day my commander gave me, as I honestly believe,
without a shadow of exaggeration, all the terrific details of a
slaver&rsquo;s life, and his strange experiences in buying slaves
in the interior.&nbsp; Compared to the awful massacres and
cruelties inflicted by the blacks on one another, the white slave
trade seemed to be philanthropic and humane.&nbsp; He had seen at
the grand custom in Dahomey 2,500 men killed, and a pool made of
their blood into which the king&rsquo;s wives threw themselves
naked and wallowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;One day fifteen were to be
tortured to death for witchcraft.&nbsp; I bought them all for an
old dress-coat,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want them, for my cargo was made up; it was only to
save the poor devils&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a slaver could not get a full cargo, and met with a weaker
vessel which was full, it was at once attacked and
plundered.&nbsp; Sometimes there would be desperate resistance,
with the aid of the slaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen the scuppers
run with blood,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; And so on, with
much more of the same sort, all of which has since been recorded
in the &ldquo;Journal of Captain Canot,&rdquo; from which latter
book I really learned nothing new.&nbsp; I might add the
&ldquo;Life of Hobart Pacha,&rdquo; whom I met many times in
London.&nbsp; A real old-fashioned slaver was fully a hundred
times worse than an average pirate, because he <i>was</i> the
latter whenever he wished to rob, and in his business was the
cause of far more suffering and death.</p>
<p>The captain was very fond of reading poetry, his favourite
being Wordsworth.&nbsp; This formed quite a tie between us.&nbsp;
He was always rather mild, quiet, and old-fashioned&mdash;in
fact, muffish.&nbsp; Once only did I see a spark from him which
showed <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>what was latent.&nbsp; Captain Jack
was describing a most extraordinary run which we had made before
a gale from Gibraltar to Cape de Creux, which was, indeed, true
enough, he having a very fast vessel.&nbsp; But the <i>Guinea</i>
captain denied that such time had ever been made by any craft
ever built.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I have had to sail sometimes pretty
fast in my time,&rdquo; he added with one sharp glance&mdash;no
more&mdash;but, as Byron says of the look of Gulleyaz,
&rsquo;twas like a short glimpse of hell.&nbsp; Pretty
fast!&nbsp; I should think so&mdash;now and then from an English
cruiser, all sails wetted down, with the gallows in the
background.&nbsp; But as I had been on board with Sam, the
question was settled.&nbsp; We <i>had</i> made a run which was
beyond all precedent.</p>
<p>I fancy that the captain, if he escaped the halter or the
wave, in after years settled down in some English coast-village,
where he read Wordsworth, and attended church regularly, and was
probably regarded as a gentle old duffer by the younger members
of society.&nbsp; But take him for all in all, he was the
mildest-mannered man that ever scuttled ship or cut a throat, and
he always behaved to me like a perfect gentleman, and never
uttered an improper word.</p>
<p>We had to wait one month till my cousin could get certain news
from America.&nbsp; We employed the time in travelling in the
south, visiting Arles, Nismes, Montpellier, and other
places.&nbsp; An English gentleman named Gordon, whom I had met
in Marseilles, had given me a letter of introduction to M. Saint
Ren&eacute; Taillandier in the latter place.&nbsp; I knew nothing
at all then about this great man, or that he was the first French
critic of German literature, but I presented my letter, and he
kindly went with me about the town to show me its
antiquities.&nbsp; I can remember discussing Gothic tracery with
him; also, that I told him I was deeply interested in the
Troubadours.&nbsp; He recommended Raynouard and several other
books, when finding that I was familiar with them all, he smiled,
and said that he believed he could teach me nothing more.&nbsp; I
did not know it then, but that word <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>from him
would have been as good as a diploma for me in Paris.</p>
<p>As for old Roman ruins and Gothic churches, and cloisters
grey, and the arrowy Rhone, and castellated
bridges&mdash;everything was in a more original moss-grown,
picturesque condition then than it now is&mdash;I enjoyed them
all with an intensity, a freshness or love, which passeth all
belief.&nbsp; I had attended Professor Dodd&rsquo;s lectures more
than once, and illuminated manuscripts, and had bought me in
Marseilles Berty&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dictionary of Gothic
Architecture,&rdquo; and got it by heart, and began to think of
making a profession of it, which, if I had known it, was the very
wisest thing I could have done.&nbsp; And that this is no idle
boast is clear from this, that I in after years made a design
according to which a &ldquo;store,&rdquo; which cost
&pound;30,000, was built, my plan being believed by another
skilled architect to have been executed by a
&ldquo;professional.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was really the sad slip
and escape of my lifetime.</p>
<p>In those days, really <i>good</i> red wine was given to every
one at every table; savoury old-fashioned dishes, vegetables, and
fruits were served far more freely and cheaply than they now are,
when every dainty is sent by rail to Paris or London, and the
drinking of Bordeaux and Burgundy did me much good.&nbsp; Blessed
days of cheapness and good quality, before chicory, the accursed
poison, had found its way into coffee, or oleomargarine was
invented, or all things canned&mdash;the world will never see ye
more!&nbsp; I have now lived for many months in a first-class
Florence hotel, and in all the time have not tasted one fresh
Italian mushroom, or truffle, or olive&mdash;nothing but
tasteless abominations bottled in France!</p>
<p>It was settled that my cousin should return from Marseilles to
the United States, while I was to go on alone to Italy.&nbsp; It
was misgivingly predicted at home by divers friends that I would
be as a lamb set loose among wolves, and lose all my money at the
outstart.&nbsp; Could they have learned that within a week after
my arrival I had been regarded by <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Spanish
smugglers as a brother, and tripped up a spy of the police, and
been promised a situation as a slaver&rsquo;s and pirate&rsquo;s
assistant, they might have thought that I had begun to learn how
to take care of myself in a hurry.&nbsp; As for losing my money,
I, by a terrible accident, <i>doubled it</i>, as I will here
describe.</p>
<p>Before leaving home, a lady cousin had made for Samuel and me
each a purse, and they were exactly alike.&nbsp; Now by a purse I
mean a real <i>purse</i>, and not a pocket-book, or a
porte-monnaie, or a wallet&mdash;that is, I mean a long bag with
a slit and two rings, and nothing else.&nbsp; And my cousin
having often scolded me for leaving mine lying about in our room,
I seeing it, as I thought, just a few minutes before my
departure, lying on the table, pocketed it, thanking God that Sam
had not found it, or scolded me.</p>
<p>I went on board the steamboat and set sail towards
Italy.&nbsp; I was sea-sick all night, but felt better the next
day.&nbsp; Then I had to pay out some money, and thought I would
look over my gold.&nbsp; To my utter amazement, it was
<i>doubled</i>!&nbsp; This I attributed to great generosity on
Sam&rsquo;s part, and I blessed him.</p>
<p>But, merciful heavens! what were my sensations at finding in
the lower depth of my pocket <i>another purse</i> also filled
with Napoleons in rouleaux!&nbsp; Then it all flashed upon
me.&nbsp; Samuel, the careful, had left <i>his</i> purse lying on
the table, and I had supposed it was mine!&nbsp; I felt as
wretched as if I had lost instead of won.</p>
<p>When I got to Naples I found a letter from my cousin bewailing
his loss.&nbsp; He implored me, if I knew nothing about it, not
to tell it to a human soul.&nbsp; There was a M. Duclaux in
Marseilles, with whom we had had our business dealings, and from
him Sam had borrowed what he needed.&nbsp; I at once requested
Captain Olive, of the steamer, to convey the purse and its
contents to M. Duclaux, which I suppose was done <i>secundem
ordinem</i>.</p>
<p>Poor Sam!&nbsp; I never met him again.&nbsp; He died of
consumption <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>soon after returning home.&nbsp; He
was one of whom I can say with truth that I never saw in him a
fault, however trifling.&nbsp; He was honour itself in
everything, as humane as was his grandfather before him, ever
cheerful and kind, merry and quaint.</p>
<p>The programme of the steamboat declared that meals were
included in the fare, &ldquo;except while stopping at a
port.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we stopped every day at Genoa or Leghorn,
or somewhere, and stayed about fifteen hours, and as almost every
passenger fell sea-sick after going ashore, the meals were not
many.&nbsp; On board the first day, I made the acquaintance of
Mr. James Temple Bowdoin, of Boston, and Mr. Mosely, of whom I
had often heard as editor of the <i>Richmond Whig</i>.&nbsp; Mr.
Bowdoin was a nephew of Lady Temple, and otherwise widely
connected with English families.&nbsp; He is now living (1892),
and I have seen a great deal of him of late years.&nbsp; With
these two I joined company, and travelled with them over
Italy.&nbsp; Both were much older than I, and experienced men of
the world; therefore I was in good hands, and better guides,
philosophers, mentors, pilots, and friends I could hardly have
found.&nbsp; Left to myself, I should probably ere the winter was
over have been the beloved chief of a gang of gypsies, or
brigands, or witches, or careering the wild sea-wave as a daring
smuggler, all in innocence and goodness of heart; for truly in
Marseilles I had begun to put forth buds of such strange kind and
promise as no friend of mine ever dreamed of.&nbsp; As it was, I
got into better, if less picturesque, society.</p>
<p>We came to Naples, and went to a hotel, and visited
everything.&nbsp; In those days the beggars and pimps and
pickpockets were beyond all modern conception.&nbsp; The
picturesqueness of the place and people were only equalled by the
stinks.&nbsp; It was like a modern realistic novel.&nbsp; We went
a great deal to the opera, also to the Blue Grotto of Capri, and
ascended Mount Vesuvius, and sought Bai&aelig;, and made, in
fact, all the excursions.&nbsp; As there were three, and
sometimes <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>half-a-dozen of our friends on these
trips, we had, naturally, with us quite a
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.&nbsp; Among these was an ill-favoured
rascal called &ldquo;John,&rdquo; who always received a dollar a
day.&nbsp; One evening some one raised the question as to what
the devil it was that John did.&nbsp; He did not carry anything,
or work to any account, or guide, or inform, yet he was always
there, and always in the way.&nbsp; So John, being called up, was
asked what he did.&nbsp; Great was his indignation, for by this
time he had got to consider himself indispensable.&nbsp; He
declared that he &ldquo;directed, and made himself generally
useful.&rdquo;&nbsp; We informed him that we would do our own
directing, and regarded him as generally useless.&nbsp; So John
was discarded.&nbsp; Since then I have found that
&ldquo;John&rdquo; is a very frequent ingredient in all societies
and Government offices.&nbsp; There are Johns in Parliament, in
the army, and in the Church.&nbsp; His children are pensioned
into the third and fourth and fortieth generation.&nbsp; In fact,
I am not sure that John is not the great social question of the
age.</p>
<p>There was in Philadelphia an Academy of Fine Arts, or Gallery,
of which my father had generously presented me with two shares,
which gave me free entrance.&nbsp; There were in it many really
excellent pictures, even a first-class Murillo, besides Wests and
Allstons.&nbsp; Unto this I had, as was my wont, read up closely,
and reflected much on what I read, so that I was to a certain
degree prepared for the marvels of art which burst on me in
Naples.&nbsp; And if I was, and always have been, <i>rather</i>
insensible to the merits of Renaissance sculpture and
architecture, I was not so to its painting, and not at all blind
to the unsurpassed glories of its classic prototypes.&nbsp;
Professor Dodd had indeed impressed it deeply and specially on my
mind that the revival of a really pure Greek taste in England, or
from the work of Stewart and Revett, was contemporary with that
for Gothic architecture, and that the appreciation of one, if
<i>true</i>, implies that of the other.&nbsp; As I was now fully
inspired with my new resolution to become an architect, I read
all that I could get on the subject, and <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>naturally
examined all remains of the past far more closely and critically
than I should otherwise have done.&nbsp; And this again inspired
in me (who always had a mania for bric-&agrave;-brac and
antiquity, which is certainly hereditary) a great interest in the
characteristic <i>decoration</i> of different ages, which thing
is the soul and life of all &aelig;sthetic arch&aelig;ology and
the minor arts; which latter again I truly claim to have brought,
I may say, into scientific form and made a branch of education in
after years.</p>
<p>I think that we were a month in Naples.&nbsp; I kept a journal
then, and indeed everywhere for three years after.&nbsp; The
reader may be thankful that I have it not, for I foresee that I
shall easily recall enough to fill ten folios of a thousand pages
solid brevier each, at this rate of reminiscences.&nbsp; As my
predilection for everything German and Gothic came out more
strongly every day, Mr. Mosely called me familiarly Germanicus, a
name which was indeed not ill-bestowed at that period.</p>
<p>From Naples we went to Rome by <i>vettura</i>, or in
carriages.&nbsp; We were two days and two nights on the
route.&nbsp; I remember that when we entered Rome, I saw the
<i>douanier</i> who examined my trunk remove from it, as he
thought unperceived, a hair-brush, book, &amp;c., and slyly hide
them behind another trunk.&nbsp; I calmly walked round, retook
and replaced them in my trunk, to the discomfiture, but not in
the least to the shame, of the thief, who only grinned.</p>
<p>And here I may say, once for all, that one can hardly fail to
have a mean opinion of human common-sense in government, when we
see this system of examining luggage still maintained.&nbsp; For
all that any country could <i>possibly</i> lose by smuggling in
trunks, &amp;c., would be a hundred-fold recompensed by the
increased amount of travel and money imported, should it be done
away with, as has been perfectly and fully proved in France; the
announcement a year ago that examination would be null or formal
having had at once the effect of greatly increasing travel.&nbsp;
And as there is not a <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>custom-house in all Europe where a
man who knows the trick cannot pull through his luggage by
bribery&mdash;the exceptions being miraculously rare&mdash;the
absurdity and folly of the system is apparent.</p>
<p>We went to the Hotel d&rsquo;Allemagne, where I fell ill,
either because I had a touch of Neapolitan malaria in me (in
those days the stench of the city was perceptible three miles out
at sea, and might have risen unto heaven above and been smelt by
the angels, had they and their home been as near to earth as was
believed by the schoolmen), or because the journey had been too
much for me.&nbsp; However, an English physician set me up all
right in two or three days (he wanted to sell us pictures which
would have cured any one&mdash;of a love of art), and then there
began indeed a glorious scampering and investigating, rooting and
rummaging&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Mid deathless lairs in solemn
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Galleries and gardens, ruins and palaces, Colosseum and
temples, churches and museums&mdash;ye have had many a better
informed and many a more inspired or gifted visitor than I, but
whether from your first Sabine days you ever had a happier one,
or one who enjoyed you more with the simple enjoyment of youth
and hope gratified, I doubt.&nbsp; Sometimes among moss-grown
arches on a sunny day, as the verd-antique lizards darted over
the stones from dark to light, while far in the distance tinkled
bells, either from cows or convents, and all was calm and sweet,
I have often wondered if it could indeed be real and not a
dream.&nbsp; Life often seemed to me then to be too good to be
true.&nbsp; And there was this at least good in my
Transcendentalism and Poly-Pantheism, that it quite unconsciously
or silently gave me many such hours; for it had sunk so deeply
into my soul, and was so much a real part thereof, that it
inspired me when I never thought of it, in which I differed by a
heaven&rsquo;s width from the professional Yankee
Transcendentalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, &AElig;sthetes,
and other spiritualists or sorcerers, <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>who always
kept their blessed belief, as a holy fugleman, full in sight, to
give them sacred straight tips, or as a Star-spangled Bannerman
who waved exceedingly, while my spirit was a shy fairy, who dwelt
far down in the depths of the all too green sea of my soul, where
it seemed to me she had ever been, or ever a storm had raised a
wave on the surface.&nbsp; Antiquely verdant green I was, no
doubt.&nbsp; And even to this day the best hours of my life are
when I hear her sweet voice &rsquo;mid ivy greens or ruins grey,
in wise books, hoar traditions.&nbsp; Be it where it will, it is
<i>that</i>, and not the world of men or books, which gives the
charm.</p>
<p>It was usual for all who drew from Torlonia&rsquo;s bank not
less than &pound;20 to be invited to his soir&eacute;es.&nbsp; To
ensure the expenses, the footman who brought the invitation
called the day after for not less than <i>five francs</i>.&nbsp;
But the entertainment was well worth the money, and more.&nbsp;
There was a good supper&mdash;Thackeray has represented a
character in &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; as devouring it&mdash;and
much amusement.</p>
<p>Now I had written my name <i>Chas.</i>, which being mistaken
for <i>Chev.</i>, I in due time, received an invitation addressed
to M. le Chevalier Godfrey de Leland.&nbsp; And it befell that I
once found a lost decoration of the Order of the Golden Spur,
which in those days <i>was</i> actually sold to anybody who asked
for it for ten pounds, and was worth &ldquo;nothing to
nobody.&rdquo;&nbsp; This caused much fun among my friends, and
from that day I was known as the Chevalier Germanicus, or the
Knight of the Golden Spur, to which I assented with very good
grace as a joke.&nbsp; There were even a few who really believed
that I had been decorated, though I never wore it, and one day I
received quite a severe remonstrance from a very patriotic
fellow-countryman against the impropriety of my thus risking my
loss of citizenship.&nbsp; Which caused me to reflect how many
there are in life who rise to such &ldquo;honours,&rdquo; Heaven
only knows how, in a back-stairs way.&nbsp; I know in London a
very great man of science, <i>nemini secundus</i>, who has never
been knighted, although the tradesman who <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>makes for
him his implements and instruments has received the title and the
<i>accolade</i>.&nbsp; <i>Fie</i> at justitia!</p>
<p>I saw at one of the Torlonia entertainments a marvellously
beautiful and strange thing, of which I had read an account in
Mme. de Sta&euml;l&rsquo;s <i>Corinne</i>.&nbsp; There was a
stage, on which appeared a young girl, plainly dressed, and
bearing a simple small scarf.&nbsp; She did not speak or dance,
or even assume &ldquo;artistic positions&rdquo;; what she did was
far more striking and wonderful.&nbsp; She merely sat or stood or
reclined in many ways, every one of which seemed to be
<i>perfectly</i> natural or habitual, and all of which were
incredibly graceful.&nbsp; I have forgotten how such women were
called in Italy.&nbsp; I am sure that this one had never been
trained to it, for the absolute ease and naturalness with which
she sat or stood could never have been taught.&nbsp; If it could,
every woman in the world would learn it.&nbsp; Ristori was one of
these instinctive <i>Graces</i>, and it constituted nearly all
the art there was in her.</p>
<p>This was in 1846.&nbsp; The Carnival of that year in Rome was
the last real one which Italy ever beheld.&nbsp; It was the very
last, for which every soul saved up all his money for months, in
order to make a wild display, and dance and revel and indulge
in</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eating,
drinking, masking,<br />
And other things which could be had for asking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then all Rome ran mad, and rode in carriages full of flowers,
or carts, or wheelbarrows, or triumphal chariots, or on camels,
horses, asses, or rails&mdash;<i>n&rsquo;importe
quoi</i>&mdash;and merrily cast <i>confetti</i> of flour or lime
at one another laughing, while grave English tourists on
balconies laboriously poured the same by the peck from tin scoops
on the heads of the multitude, under the delusion that they too
were enjoying themselves and &ldquo;doing&rdquo; the Carnival
properly.&nbsp; It was the one great rule among Italians that no
man should in the Carnival, under any provocation whatever, lose
his temper.&nbsp; And here John Bull often tripped up.&nbsp; On
the last night of <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the last Carnival&mdash;that great
night&mdash;there was the <i>Senza Moccolo</i> or extinguishment
of lights, in which everybody bore a burning taper, and tried to
blow or knock out the light of his neighbour.&nbsp; Now, being
tall, I held my taper high with one hand, well out of danger,
while with a broad felt hat in the other I extinguished the
children of light like a priest.&nbsp; I threw myself into all
the roaring fun like a wild boy, as I was, and was never so
jolly.&nbsp; Observing a pretty young English lady in an open
carriage, I thrice extinguished her light, at which she laughed,
but at which her brother or beau did not, for he got into a great
rage, even the first time, and bade me begone.&nbsp; Whereupon I
promptly renewed the attack, and then repeated it,
&ldquo;according to the rules of the game,&rdquo; whereat he
began to curse and swear, when I, in the Italian fashion of
rebuke (to the delight of sundry Italians), pointed my finger at
him and hissed; which constituted the winning <i>point
d&rsquo;honneur</i> in the game.</p>
<p>There, too, was the race of wild horses, right down through
the Corso or Condotti, well worth seeing, and very exciting, and
game suppers o&rsquo;nights after the opera, and the meeting with
many swells and noted folk, and now it all seems like some memory
of a wild phantasmagoria or hurried magic-lantern
show&mdash;galleries and ruins by day, and gaiety by night.&nbsp;
Even so do all the scenes of life roll up together at its end,
often getting mixed.</p>
<p>Yet another Roman memory or two.&nbsp; We had taken lodgings
in the Via Condotti, where we had a nice sitting-room in common
and a good coal-fire.&nbsp; Our landlady was lady-like and spoke
French, and had long been a governess in the great Borghese
family.&nbsp; As for her husband, there were thousands of
Liberals far and wide who spoke of him as the greatest scoundrel
unhung, for he was at the head of the Roman police, and I verily
believe knew more iniquity than the Pope himself.&nbsp; It would
have been against all nature and precedent if I had not become
his dear friend and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, which I did
accordingly, for I liked him very much <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>indeed, and
Heaven knows that such a rum couple of friends as Giuseppe Navone
and myself, when out walking together, could not at that time
have been found in Europe.</p>
<p>It may here be observed that I was decidedly getting on in the
quality of my Mentors, for, as regarded morals and humanity, my
old pirate and slaver friend was truly as a lamb and an angel of
light compared to Navone.&nbsp; And I will further indicate, as
this book will prove, that if I was not at the age of
twenty-three the most accomplished young scoundrel in all Europe,
it was not for want of such magnificent opportunities and friends
as few men ever enjoyed.&nbsp; But it was always my fate to
neglect or to be unable to profit by advantages, as, for
instance, in mathematics; nor in dishonesty did I succeed one
whit better, which may be the reason why the two are somehow
dimly connected in my mind.&nbsp; Here I think I see the
unfathomable smile in the eye of Professor Dodd (it never got
down to his lips), who was the incarnate soul of purity and
honour.&nbsp; But then the banker, E. Fenzi, who swindled me out
of nearly 500 francs, was an arithmetician, and I write under a
sense of recent wrong.&nbsp; How this loss, and Fenzi&rsquo;s
failure, flight, and the fuss which it all caused in Florence,
were accurately foretold me by a witch, may be read in detail in
my &ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains in Tuscan Tradition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
London: T. Fisher Unwin.</p>
<p>My landlady was a very zealous Catholic, and tried to convert
me.&nbsp; This was a new experience, and I enjoyed it.&nbsp; I
proved malleable.&nbsp; So she called in a Jesuit priest to
perfect the work.&nbsp; I listened with deep interest to his
worn-out <i>fade</i> arguments, made a few points of feeble
objection for form&rsquo;s sake, yielded, and met him more than
half way.&nbsp; But somehow he never called again.&nbsp; <i>Latet
anguis in herba</i>&mdash;my grass was rather too green, I
suppose.&nbsp; I was rather sorry, for I expected some
amusement.&nbsp; But I had been <i>too</i> deep for the
Jesuit&mdash;and for myself.</p>
<p>The time came for my departure.&nbsp; I was to go alone on to
Florence, in advance of my friends.&nbsp; Navone arranged <!--
page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>everything nicely for me: I was to go by diligence on
to Civita Vecchia, where I was to call on a relative of his, who
kept a bric-&agrave;-brac shop.&nbsp; I did not know how or why
it was that I was treated with such great respect, as if with
fear, by the conductor, and by all on the road.&nbsp; I was <i>en
route</i> all night, and in the morning, very weary, I went to a
hotel, called a commissionaire, and bade him get my passport from
the police, and have it <i>vis&eacute;e</i>, and secure me a
passage on the boat to Leghorn.&nbsp; He returned very soon, and
said with an air of bewilderment, &ldquo;Signore, you sent me on
a useless errand.&nbsp; Here is your passport put all <i>en
r&egrave;gle</i>, and your passage is all secured!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw it at once.&nbsp; The kind fatherly care of the great
and good Navone had done it all!&nbsp; He had watched over me
invisibly and mysteriously all the time during the night; on the
road I was a pet child of the Roman police!&nbsp; The Vehmgericht
had endorsed me with three crosses!&nbsp; Therefore the passport
and the passage were all right, and the captain was very
deferential, and I got to Florence safely.</p>
<p>In Florence I went to the first hotel, which was then in what
is now known as the Palazzo Feroni, or Viesseux&rsquo;s, the
great circulating library of Italy.&nbsp; It is a fine
machicolated building, which was in the Middle Ages the prison of
the Republic.&nbsp; From my window I had a fine view of the Via
Tornabuoni&mdash;in which I had coffee since I concluded the last
line.&nbsp; There were but three or four persons the first
evening at the <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; One was a
very beautiful Polish countess, who spoke French perfectly.&nbsp;
She was very fascinating, and, when she ate a salad, smeared her
lovely mouth and cheeks all round with oil to her ears.&nbsp;
Some one said something to her about the manner in which the
serfs were treated in Poland, whereupon she replied with great
vivacity that the Polish serfs were even more degraded and
barbarous than those of Russia.&nbsp; Which remark inspired in me
certain reflections, which were amply developed in after years by
the perusal of Von Moltke&rsquo;s work on Poland, and more
recently <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of that very interesting novel
called &ldquo;The Deluge.&rdquo;&nbsp; If freedom shrieked when
Kosciusko fell, it was probably, from a humanitarian point of
view, with joy.</p>
<p>There was, however, at the same hotel a singular man, a
Lithuanian Pole named Andr&eacute;kovitch, with whom I became
very intimate, and whom I met in after years in Paris and in
America.&nbsp; He had been at a German university, where he had
imbibed most liberal and revolutionary ideas.&nbsp; He
subsequently took part in one or two revolutions, and was
exiled.&nbsp; He had read about Emerson in a French magazine, and
was enthusiastic over him.&nbsp; In strange contrast to him was a
handsome young man from the Italian Tyrol, who was, like the Pole
and myself, full of literary longings, but who was still quite a
Roman Catholic.&nbsp; He knew about as much, or as little, of the
world as I did, and was &ldquo;gentle and bland.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When we bade farewell, he wept, and kissed me.&nbsp;
Andr&eacute;kovitch was eccentric, wild, and Slavonian-odd to
look at at any time.&nbsp; One evening he came into my room clad
in scarlet dressing-gown, and having altogether the appearance of
a sorcerer just out of a Sabbat.&nbsp; The conversation took a
theological turn.&nbsp; Andr&eacute;kovitch was the ragged
remnant of a Catholic, but a very small one.&nbsp; He sailed
close to the wind, and neared Rationalism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Pope! . . .&rdquo; exclaimed the Tyrolese.</p>
<p>Andr&eacute;kovitch rose, looking more sorcerer or Zamiel-like
than ever, and exclaiming, &ldquo;The Pope be&mdash;!&rdquo; left
the room.&nbsp; The last word was lost in the slam of the
door.&nbsp; It was a melodramatic departure, and as such has ever
been impressed on my memory.</p>
<p>My father, while a merchant, and also my uncle, had done a
very large business in Florentine straw goods, and I had received
letters to several English houses who had corresponded with
them.&nbsp; I heard, long after, that my arrival had caused a
small panic in Florence in business circles, it being apprehended
that I had come out to establish a rival branch, or to buy at
head-quarters for the American &ldquo;straw-market.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>I believe that their fears were appeased when I
interviewed them.&nbsp; One of these worthy men had been so long
in Italy that he had caught a little of its superstition.&nbsp;
He wished to invest in lottery tickets, and asked me for lucky
numbers, which I gave him.</p>
<p>As I write these lines in Florence, I have within half-an-hour
called for the first time on an old witch or <i>strega</i>, whom
I found surrounded by herbs and bottles, and a magnificent cat,
who fixed his eyes on me all the time, as if he recognised a
friend.&nbsp; I found, however, that she only knew the common
vulgar sorceries, and was unable to give me any of the higher
<i>scongiurazioni</i> or conjurations; and as I left, the old
sorceress said respectfully and admiringly, &ldquo;You come to
<i>me</i> to learn, O Maestro, but it is fitter that I take
lessons from you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she asked me for &ldquo;the
wizard blessing,&rdquo; which I gave her in Romany.&nbsp; So my
first and last experiences in the deep and dark art come
together!</p>
<p>I became acquainted in Florence with Hiram Powers, which
reminds me that I once in Rome dined <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> to
Gibson and several other artists, with whom I became intimate as
young men readily do.&nbsp; I contrived to study architecture,
and made myself very much at home in a few studios.&nbsp; The
magnificent <i>Fiorara</i>, or flower-girl, whom so many will
remember for many years, was then in the full bloom of her
beauty.&nbsp; She and others gave flowers to any strangers whom
they met, not expecting money down, but when a man departed the
flower-girls were always on hand to solicit a gratuity.&nbsp;
Twenty years later this same Fiorara, still a very handsome
woman, remembered me, and gave my wife a handsome bouquet on
leaving.</p>
<p>I studied Proven&ccedil;al and Italian poetry in illuminated
MSS. in the Ambrosian or Laurentian Library, and took my coffee
at Doney&rsquo;s, and saw more of Florence in a few weeks&rsquo;
time than I have ever done since in any one of my residences
here, though some of them have been for six and nine
months.&nbsp; As is quite natural.&nbsp; Who that lives in London
ever goes to <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>see the Tower?&nbsp; All things in
Europe were so new and fresh and beautiful and wonderful to me
then, and I had been yearning for them so earnestly for so many
years, and this golden freedom followed so closely on the deadly
<i>ennui</i> of Princeton, that I could never see enough.</p>
<p>If any of my readers want to know something of sorcery, I can
tell them that among its humblest professors it is perfectly
understood that pleasure or enjoyment is one of its deepest
mysteries or principles, as an integral part of
fascination.&nbsp; So I can feel an <i>enchantment</i>, sometimes
almost incredible, in gazing on a Gothic ruin in sunshine, or a
beautiful face, a picture by Carpaccio, Norse interlaces, lovable
old books, my amethyst amulet, or a garden.&nbsp; For if you
could sway life and death, and own millions, or walk invisible,
you could do no more than <i>enjoy</i>; therefore you had better
learn to enjoy much without such power.&nbsp; Thus endeth the
first lesson!</p>
<p>I arrived in Venice.&nbsp; There had been a time in America
when, if I could have truthfully declared that I had ever been in
a gondola, I should have felt as if I held a diploma of nobility
in the Grand Order of Cosmopolites.&nbsp; Having been conveyed in
one to my hotel on the Grand Canal, I felt that I at last held
it!&nbsp; Now I had really mastered the three great cities of
Italy, which was the first and greatest part of all travel in all
the world of culture and of art.&nbsp; Fate might hurl me back to
America, or even into New Jersey, but I had &ldquo;swum in a
gondola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I very soon made the acquaintance of two brothers from New
York named Seymour, somewhat older than myself, and men of
reading and culture.&nbsp; With them I &ldquo;sight-saw&rdquo;
the city.&nbsp; I had read Venice up rather closely at Princeton,
and had formed a great desire to go on the Bridge of Sighs.&nbsp;
For some reason this was then very strictly forbidden.&nbsp; Our
Consul, who was an enterprising young man, told me that he had
been for months trying to effect it in vain.&nbsp; It at once
became apparent to me as a piece of manifest destiny that I must
do it.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>One day I had with me a clever fellow, a commissionaire
or guide, and consulted him.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I think it may
be done.&nbsp; You look like an Austrian, and may be taken for an
officer.&nbsp; Walk boldly into the chief&rsquo;s office, and ask
for the keys of the bridge; only show a little cheek.&nbsp; You
may get them.&nbsp; Give the chief&rsquo;s man two francs when
you come out.&nbsp; At the worst, he can only refuse to give
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a very cheeky undertaking, but I ventured on it
with the calmness of innocence.&nbsp; I went into the office, and
said, &ldquo;The keys to the bridge, if you please!&rdquo; as if
I were in an official hurry on State business.&nbsp; The official
stared, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand that you formally demand the
keys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ja wohl</i>, certainly; at once, if you
please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were handed over to me, and I saw the bridge and gave the
two francs, and all was well.&nbsp; But it gave me no renown in
Venice, for the Consul and all my friends regarded it as a
fabulous joke of mine, inspired by poetic genius.&nbsp; But I
sometimes think that the official who yielded up the keys, and
the man whom he sent with me, and perhaps the commissionaire, all
had a put-up job of it among them on those keys, and several
glasses all round out of those two francs.&nbsp; <i>Quien
sabe</i>?&nbsp; <i>Vive la bagatelle</i>!</p>
<p>We went on an excursion to Padua.&nbsp; What I remember is,
that what impressed me most was a placard here and there
announcing that a work on Oken had just appeared!&nbsp; This
rather startled me.&nbsp; Whether it was for or against the great
German offshoot from Schelling, it proved that somebody in Italy
had actually studied him!&nbsp; <i>Eppure si muove</i>, I
thought.&nbsp; It cannot be true that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Padua! the lamp of learning<br />
In thy halls no more is burning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been there several times since.&nbsp; All that I now
recall is that the hotel was not very good the last time.</p>
<p>I met in Venice a young New Yorker named Clark, who <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>had crossed with me on the ship.&nbsp; He was a merry
companion.&nbsp; Sailing with him one morning in a gondola along
the Grand Canal, we saw sitting before a hotel its porter, who
was an unmistakable American man of full colour.&nbsp; Great was
Clark&rsquo;s delight, and he called out, &ldquo;I say, Buck!
what the devil are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a delighted grin, the man and brother replied in deep
Southern accent&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey sets me hyar fo&rsquo; a bait to &rsquo;tice de
Americans with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard subsequently that he had come from America with his
mistress, and served her faithfully till there came into the
service a pretty French girl.&nbsp; Great was the anger of the
owner of the man to find that he had unmistakably
&ldquo;enticed&rdquo; the maid.&nbsp; To which he replied that it
was a free country; that he had married the damsel&mdash;she was
his wife; and so the pair at once packed up and departed.</p>
<p>We used to hear a great deal before the war from Southerns
about the devotion of their slaves, but there were a great many
instances in which the fidelity did not exactly hold water.&nbsp;
There was an old Virginia gentleman who owned one of these
faithful creatures.&nbsp; He took him several times to the North,
and as the faithful one always turned a deaf ear to the
Abolitionists, and resisted every temptation to depart, and
refused every free-ticket offered for a journey on &ldquo;the
underground railway,&rdquo; and went back to Richmond, he was of
course trusted to an unlimited extent.&nbsp; When the war ended
he was freed.&nbsp; Some one asked him one day how he could have
been such a fool as to remain a slave.&nbsp; He
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kase it paid.&nbsp; Dere&rsquo;s nuffin pays like being
a dewoted darkey.&nbsp; De las&rsquo; time I went Norf wid massa
I made &rsquo;nuff out of him to buy myself free twice&rsquo;t
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless there were many instances of &ldquo;pampered and
petted&rdquo; household servants who had grown up in families who
had sense to know that they could never live free in the freezing
North without hard work.&nbsp; These were the only <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>devoted ones of whom I ever heard.&nbsp; The
field-hands, disciplined by the lash, and liable to have their
wives or children or relatives sold from them&mdash;<i>as
happened on an average once at least in a life</i>&mdash;were all
to a man quite ready to forsake &ldquo;ole massa&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dear ole missus,&rdquo; and flee unto freedom.&nbsp; And
what a vile mean wretch any man must be who would sacrifice his
<i>freedom</i> to any other living being, be it for love or
feudal fidelity&mdash;and what a villain must the man be who
would accept such a gift!</p>
<p>I had never thought much of this subject before I left
home.&nbsp; I did not <i>like</i> slavery, nor to think about
it.&nbsp; But in Europe I did like such thought, and I returned
fully impressed with the belief that slavery was, as Charles
Sumner said, &ldquo;the sum of all crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp; In which
summation he showed himself indeed a &ldquo;sumner,&rdquo; as it
was called of yore.&nbsp; Which cost me many a bitter hour and
much sorrow, for there was hardly a soul whom I knew, except my
mother, to whom an Abolitionist was not simply the same thing as
a disgraceful, discreditable malefactor.&nbsp; Even my father,
when angry with me one day, could think of nothing bitterer than
to tell me that I knew I was <i>an Abolitionist</i>.&nbsp; I kept
it to myself, but the reader can have no idea of what I was made
to suffer for years in Philadelphia, where everything Southern
was exalted and worshipped with a baseness below that of the
blacks themselves.</p>
<p>For all of which in after years I had full and complete
recompense.&nbsp; I lived to see the young ladies who were ready
to kneel before any man who owned
&ldquo;sl&auml;-&auml;ves,&rdquo; detest the name of
&ldquo;South,&rdquo; and to learn that their fathers and friends
were battling to the death to set those slaves free.&nbsp; I
lived to see the roof of the &ldquo;gentlemanly planter,&rdquo;
who could not of yore converse a minute with me without letting
me know that he considered himself as an immeasurably higher
being than myself, blaze over his head amid yell and groan and
sabre-stroke&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And death-shots flying thick and
fast,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>while he fled for life, and the freed slaves sang hymns
of joy to God.&nbsp; I saw the roads, five miles wide, level,
barren, and crossed with ruts, where Northern and Southern armies
had marched, and where villages and plantations had once
been.&nbsp; I saw countless friends or acquaintances, who had
once smiled with pitying scorn at me, or delicately turned the
conversation when Abolition was mentioned in my presence, become
all at once blatant &ldquo;nigger-worshippers,&rdquo; abundant in
proof that they had always had &ldquo;an indescribable horror of
slavery&rdquo;&mdash;it was, in fact, so indescribable that
(until it was evident that the North would conquer) none of them
ever succeeded in giving anybody the faintest conception of it,
or any idea that it existed.&nbsp; I can still recall how
gingerly and cautiously&mdash;&ldquo;paw by paw into the
water&rdquo;&mdash;these dough faces became hard-baked
Abolitionists, far surpassing us of the Old Guard in zeal.&nbsp;
I lived to see men who had voted against Grant and <i>reviled</i>
him become his most intimate friends.&nbsp; But enough of such
memories.&nbsp; It is characteristic of the American people that,
while personally very vindictive, they forgive and forget
political offences far more amicably&mdash;very far&mdash;than do
even the English.&nbsp; However, in the case of the Rebellion,
this was a very easy thing for those to do who had not, like us
old Abolitionists, borne the burden and heat of the day, and who,
coming in at the eleventh hour, got all the contracts and
offices!&nbsp; It never came into the head of any man to write a
<i>Dictionnaire des Girouettes</i> in America.&nbsp; These late
converts had never known what it was to be Abolitionists while it
was &ldquo;unfashionable,&rdquo; and have, as it were, live coals
laid on the quivering heart&mdash;as I had a thousand times
during many years&mdash;all for believing the tremendous and
plain truth that <i>slavery</i> was a thousand times wickeder
than the breach of all the commandments put together.&nbsp; It
was so peculiar for any man, not a Unitarian or Quaker, to be an
<i>Abolitionist</i> in Philadelphia from 1848 until 1861, that
such exceptions were pointed out as if they had been
Chinese&mdash;&ldquo;and d---d bad Chinese at that,&rdquo; as a
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>friend added to whom I made the remark.&nbsp; So much
for man&rsquo;s relations with poor humanity.</p>
<p>My old friend, B. P. Hunt, was one of these few
exceptions.&nbsp; His was a very strange experience.&nbsp; After
ceasing to edit a &ldquo;selected&rdquo; magazine, he went to and
fro for many voyages to Ha&iuml;ti, where, singular as it may
seem, his experiences of the blacks made of him a stern
Abolitionist.&nbsp; He married a connection of mine, and lived
comfortably in Philadelphia, I think, until the eighties.</p>
<p>I travelled with Mr. Clark from Venice to Milan, where we made
a short visit.&nbsp; I remember an old soldier who spoke six
languages, who was cicerone of the roof of the Cathedral, and
whom I found still on the roof twenty years later, and still
speaking the same six tongues.&nbsp; I admired the building as a
beautiful fancy, exquisitely decorated, but did not think much of
it as a specimen of Gothic architecture.&nbsp; It is the best
test of &aelig;sthetic culture and knowledge in the world.&nbsp;
When you hear anybody praise it as the most exquisite or perfect
Gothic cathedral in existence, you may expect to hear the critic
admire the designs of Chippendale furniture or the decoration of
St. Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So we passed through beautiful Lombardy and came to Domo
d&rsquo;Ossola, where a strange German-Italian patois was
spoken.&nbsp; It was in the middle of April, and we were warned
that it would be very dangerous to cross the Simplon, but we went
on all night in a carriage on sleigh-runners, through intervals
of snowstorm.&nbsp; Now and then we came to rushing
mountain-torrents bursting over the road; far away, ever and
anon, we heard the roar of a <i>lauwine</i> or avalanche;
sometimes I looked out, and could see straight down below me a
thousand feet into an abyss or on a headlong stream.&nbsp; We
entered the great tunnel directly from another, for the snow lay
twenty feet deep on the road, and a passage had been dug under it
for several hundred feet, and so two tunnels were
connected.&nbsp; Just in the worst of the road beyond, and in the
bitterest cold, we met a sleigh, in which were an English <!--
page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>gentleman and a very beautiful young lady, apparently
his daughter, going to Italy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw her but an
instant, yet methinks I see her now&rdquo;&mdash;a sweet picture
in a strange scene.&nbsp; Poets used to &ldquo;me-think&rdquo;
and &ldquo;me-seem&rdquo; more in those days, but we endured
it.&nbsp; Then in the morning we saw Brieg, far down below us in
the valley in green leaves and sunshine, and when we got there
then I realised that we were in a new land.</p>
<p>We had a great giant of a German conductor, who seemed to
regard Clark and me as under his special care.&nbsp; Once when we
had wandered afar to look at something, and it was time for the
stage or <i>Eilwagen</i> to depart, he hunted us up, scolded us
&ldquo;like a Dutch uncle&rdquo; in German, and drove us along
before him like two bad boys to the diligence, &ldquo;pawing
up&rdquo; first one and then the other, after which, shoving us
in, he banged and locked the door with a grunt of satisfaction,
even as the Giant Blunderbore locked the children in the coffer
after slamming down the lid.&nbsp; Across the scenes and shades
of forty years, that picture of the old conductor driving us like
two unruly urchins back to school rises, never to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>We went by mountains and lakes and Gothic towns, rocks,
forests, old chateaux, and rivers&mdash;the road was wild in
those days&mdash;till we came to Geneva.&nbsp; Thence Clark went
his way to Paris, and I remained alone for a week.&nbsp; I had,
it is true, a letter of introduction to a very eminent
Presbyterian Swiss clergyman, so I sent it in with my card.&nbsp;
His wife came out on the balcony, looked coolly down at me, and
concluding, I suppose from my appearance, that I was one of the
ungodly, went in and sent out word that her husband was out, and
would be gone for an indefinite period, and that she was
engaged.&nbsp; The commissionaire who was with me&mdash;poor
devil!&mdash;was dreadfully mortified; but I was not very much
astonished, and, indeed, I was treated in much the same manner,
or worse, by a colleague of this pious man in Paris, or rather by
his wife.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>I believe that what kept me a week in Geneva was the
white wine and trout.&nbsp; At the end of the time I set out to
the north, and on the way met with some literary or professional
German, who commended to me the &ldquo;Pfisterer-Zunft&rdquo; or
Bakers&rsquo; Guild as a cheap and excellent hostelry.&nbsp; And
it was curious enough, in all conscience.&nbsp; During the Middle
Ages, and down to a very recent period, the <i>Z&uuml;nfte</i> or
trade-guilds in the Swiss cities carried it with a high
hand.&nbsp; Even the gentlemen could only obtain rights as
citizens by enrolling themselves as the trade of
aristocrats.&nbsp; I had heard of the boy who thought he would
like to be bound apprentice to the king; in Berne he might have
been entered for a lower branch of the business.&nbsp; These
guilds had their own local taverns, inns, or <i>Herbergs</i>,
where travelling colleagues of the calling might lodge at
moderate rates, but nobody else.&nbsp; However, as time rolled
by, these <i>Z&uuml;nfte</i> or guild-lodgings were opened to
strangers.&nbsp; One of the last which did so was that of the
<i>Pfister</i> or bakers (Latin, <i>pistor</i>), and this had
only been done a few weeks ere I went there.&nbsp; As a literary
man whom I met on the ramparts said to me, &ldquo;That place is
still strong in the Middle Age.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a quaint old
building, and to get to my room I had to cross the great
guild-hall of the Ancient and Honourable Society of Bakers.&nbsp;
There were the portraits of all the Grand Masters of the Order
from the fourteenth or fifteenth century on the walls, and the
concentrated antique tobacco-smoke of as many ages in the air,
which, to a Princeton graduate, was no more than the scent of a
rose to a bee.</p>
<p>I could speak a little German&mdash;not much&mdash;but the
degree to which I felt, sympathised with, and understood
everything Deutsch, passeth all words and all mortal
belief.&nbsp; <i>Sit verbo venia</i>!&nbsp; But I do not believe
that any human being ever crossed the frontier who had thought
himself down, or rather raised himself up, into Teutonism as I
had on so slight a knowledge of the language, even as a spider
throweth up an invisible thread on high, and then travels on
it.&nbsp; Which <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>thing was perceived marvellously
soon, and not without some amazement, by the Germans, who have
all at least this one point in common with Savages, New
Jerseymen, Red Indians, Negroes, Gypsies, and witches, that they
by mystic sympathy <i>know those who like them</i>, and take to
them accordingly, guided by some altogether inexplicable clue or
<i>Hexengarn</i>, even as deep calleth unto deep and star
answereth star without a voice.&nbsp; Whence it was soon observed
at Heidelberg by an American student that &ldquo;Leland would
abuse the Dutch all day long if he saw fit, but never allowed
anybody else to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; The which thing, as I think,
argues the very <i>ne plus ultra</i> of sympathy.</p>
<p>I found my way to Strasburg, where I went to the tip-top
outside of the cathedral, and took the railway train for
Heidelberg.&nbsp; And here I had an adventure, which, though
trifling to the last degree, was to me such a great and new
experience that I will describe it, let the reader think what he
will.&nbsp; I went naturally enough first-class, so uncommon a
thing then in Germany that people were wont to say that only
princes, Englishmen, and asses did so.&nbsp; There entered the
same carriage a very lady-like and pretty woman.&nbsp; The guard,
seeing this, concluded that&mdash;whatever he concluded, he
carefully drew down all the curtains, looking at me with a
cheerful, genial air of intense mystery, as if to say, &ldquo;I
twig; it&rsquo;s all right; I&rsquo;ll keep your
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a positive fact that all this puzzled me
amazingly.&nbsp; There were many things in which I, the friend
and pupil of Navone, was as yet as innocent as a babe
unborn.&nbsp; The lady seemed to be amused&mdash;as well she
might.&nbsp; <i>Sancta simplicitas</i>!&nbsp; I asked her why the
conductor had drawn the curtains.&nbsp; She laughed, and
explained that he possibly thought we were a bridal pair or
lovers.&nbsp; Common sense and ordinary politeness naturally
inspired the reply that I wished we were, which declaration was
so amiably received that I suggested the immediate institution of
such an arrangement.&nbsp; Which was so far favourably received
that it was sealed with <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>a
kiss.&nbsp; However, the seal was not broken.&nbsp; I think the
lady must have been very much amused.&nbsp; It is not without due
reflection that I record this.&nbsp; Kissing went for very little
in Germany in those days.&nbsp; It was about as common in Vienna
as shaking hands.&nbsp; But this was my first experience in
it.&nbsp; So I record it, because it seems as if some benevolent
fairy had welcomed me to Germany; it took place just as we
crossed the frontier.&nbsp; However, I found out some time after,
by a strange accident, that my fairy was the wife of a banker who
lived beyond Heidelberg; and at Heidelberg I left her and went to
the first hotel in the town.</p>
<p>I had formed no plans, and had no letters to anybody.&nbsp; I
had read Howitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Student Life in Germany&rdquo;
through and through, so I thought I would study in
Heidelberg.&nbsp; But how to begin?&nbsp; That was the
question.&nbsp; I went into a shop and bought some cigars.&nbsp;
There I consulted with the shopkeeper as to what I should
do.&nbsp; Could he refer me to some leading authority in the
University, known to him, who would give me advice?&nbsp; He
could, and advised me to consult with the Pedell Capelmann.</p>
<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t know it, but Pedell&mdash;meaning beadle,
commonly called Poodle by the students&mdash;was the
head-constable of the University.&nbsp; In honest truth I
supposed he must be the President or Pro-Rector.&nbsp; So I went
to Pedell Capelmann.&nbsp; His appearance did not quite
correspond to my idea of a learned professor.&nbsp; He was an
immensely burly, good-natured fellow, who came in in his
shirt-sleeves, and who, when he learned what I wanted, burst out
into a <i>Her&rsquo;r&rsquo;r&rsquo; Gottsdonerrwetter</i>! of
surprise, as he well might.&nbsp; But I knew that the Germans
were a very <i>sans fa&ccedil;on bourgeois</i> people, and still
treated him with deep respect.&nbsp; He suggested that, as there
were a great many American students there, I had better call on
them.&nbsp; He himself would take me to see the Herr O&mdash;,
with whom, as I subsequently learned, he had more than once had
discussions relative to questions of University-municipal
discipline.&nbsp; As for the startling peculiarity <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>which attended my introduction to University life, it
is best summed up in the remark which the Herr O. (of Baltimore)
subsequently made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God, fellows! <i>he made his first call on old
Capelmann</i>!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took me to the Herr O. and introduced me.&nbsp; I was
overwhelmed with my cordial reception.&nbsp; There was at once
news sent forth that a new man and a brother fellow-countryman
had come to join the ranks.&nbsp; &ldquo;And messengers through
all the land sought Sir Tannh&auml;user out.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
pumped dry as to my precedents, and as I came fresh from
Princeton and had been through Italy, I was approved of.&nbsp;
The first thing was a discussion as to where I was to live.&nbsp;
The Frau Directorinn Louis in the University Place had two fine
rooms which had just been occupied by a prince.&nbsp; So we went
and secured the rooms, which were indeed very pleasant, and by no
means dear as it seemed to me.&nbsp; I was to breakfast in my
rooms, dine with the family at one o&rsquo;clock, and sup about
town.</p>
<p>Then there was a grand council as to what I had better study,
and over my prospects in life; and it was decided that, as the
law-students were the most distinguished or swell of all, I had
better be a lawyer.&nbsp; So it was arranged that I should attend
Mittermayer&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; lectures; to all of which I
cheerfully assented.&nbsp; The next step was to give a grand
supper in honour of my arrival.&nbsp; After the dinner and the
wine, I drank twelve <i>schoppens</i> of beer, and then excused
myself on the plea of having letters to write.&nbsp; I believe,
however, that I forgot to write the letters.&nbsp; And here I may
say, once for all, that having discovered that, if I had no gift
for mathematics, I had a great natural talent for Rheinwein and
lager, I did not bury that talent in a napkin, but, like the rest
of my friends, made the most of it, firstly, during two semesters
in Heidelberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then I bolted off to Munich,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And within the year,<br />
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Underneath my German tunic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stowed whole butts of beer;<br />
For I drank like fifty fishes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drank till all was blue,<br />
For whenever I was vicious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thirsty too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of which &ldquo;dire deboshing&rdquo; was that,
having come to Europe with a soul literally attenuated and
starved for want of the ordinary gaiety and amusement which all
youth requires, my life in Princeton having been one continued
strain of a sobriety which continually sank into subdued
melancholy, and a body just ready to yield to consumption, I grew
vigorous and healthy, or, as the saying is, &ldquo;hearty as a
buck.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that if my Cousin Sam had gone on
with me even-pace, that he would have lived till to-day.&nbsp;
When we came abroad I seemed to be the weakest; he returned, and
died in a few months from our hereditary disease.&nbsp; How many
hecatombs of young men have been murdered by
&ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;total abstinence,&rdquo;
miscalled <i>temperance</i>, in our American colleges, can never
be known; perhaps it is as well that it never will be; for if it
were, there would be a rush to the other extreme, which would
&ldquo;upset society.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here be it noted that,
with all our inordinate national or international Anglo-Saxon
sense of superiority to everybody and everything foreign, we are
in the <i>main</i> thing&mdash;that is, the truly rational
enjoyment of life and the art of living&mdash;utterly inferior to
the German and Latin races.&nbsp; We are for the most part either
too good or too bad&mdash;totally abstemious or raving
drunk&mdash;always in a hurry after excitement or in a worry over
our sins, or those of our neighbours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rest, rest,
perturbed Yankee, <i>rest</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My rooms were on the ground-floor, the bedroom looking into
the University Square and my study into a garden.&nbsp; Next door
to me dwelt Paulus, the king of the Rationalists.&nbsp; He was
then, I believe, ninety-four years of age.&nbsp; He remained
daily till about twelve or one in a comatose condition, <!-- page
145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>when he awoke and became lively till about three, when
he sank into sleep again.&nbsp; His days were like those of a far
Northern winter, lit by the sun at the same hours.</p>
<p>The next morning a very gentlemanly young man knocked at my
door, and entered and asked in perfect English for a Mr. Bell,
who lived in the same house.&nbsp; I informed him that Mr. Bell
was out, but asked him to enter my room and take a chair, which
he did, conversing with me for half an hour, when he departed,
leaving a card on a side-table.&nbsp; In a few minutes later, O.,
who was of the kind who notice everything, entered, took up the
card, and read on it the name and address of the young Grand Duke
of Baden, who was naturally by far the greatest man in the
country, he being its hereditary ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the devil did you get this?&rdquo; asked O., and
all, in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only the
Duke.&nbsp; He has just been in here making a call.&nbsp; If you
fellows had come five minutes sooner you&rsquo;d have seen
him.&nbsp; Have some beer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impression that I was a queer lot, due to my making my
first call on Capelmann <i>et cetera</i>, was somewhat
strengthened by this card, until I explained how I came by
it.&nbsp; But as Dr. Johnson in other words remarked, there are
people to whom such queer things happen daily, and others to whom
they occur once a year.&nbsp; And there was never yet a living
soul who entered into my daily life who did not observe that I
belong to the former class.&nbsp; If I have a guardian angel, it
must be Edgar A. Poe&rsquo;s Angel of the Odd.&nbsp; But he
generally comes to those who belong to him!</p>
<p>It was a long time before I profited much by my lectures,
because it was fearful work for me to learn German.&nbsp; I
engaged a tutor, and worked hard, and read a great deal, and
talked it <i>con amore</i>; but few persons would believe how
slowly I learned it, and with what incredible labour.&nbsp; How
often have I cursed up hill and down dale, the Tower of Babel,
which first brought the curse of languages upon the <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>world!&nbsp; And what did I ever have to do with that
Tower?&nbsp; Had I lived in those days, I would never have laid
hand to the work in merry, sunny, lazy Babylon, nor contributed a
brick to it.&nbsp; By the way, it was a juvenile conjecture of
mine that the Tower of Babel was destroyed for being a
shot-tower, in which ammunition was prepared to be used by the
heathen.&nbsp; Which theory might very well have been inspired by
a verse from the old Puritanical rendering of the
Psalms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye race itt is not alwayes gott<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By him who swiftest runns,<br />
Nor y<sup>e</sup> Battell by y<sup>e</sup> Peo-pel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shoot with longest gunnes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even before I had gone to Princeton I had read and learned a
great deal relative to Justinus Kerner, the great German
supernaturalist, mystic, and poet, firstly from a series of
articles in the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>, and later from
a translation of &ldquo;The Seeress of Prevorst,&rdquo; and
several of the good man&rsquo;s own romances and lyrics.&nbsp; I
suppose that, of all men on the face of the earth, I should have
at that time preferred to meet him.&nbsp; Wherefore, as a matter
of course, it occurred that one fine morning a pleasant
gentlemanly German friend of mine, who spoke English perfectly,
and whose name was R&uuml;cker, walked into my room, and proposed
that we should take a two or three days&rsquo; walk up the Neckar
with our knapsacks, and visit the famous old ruined castle of the
Weibertreue.&nbsp; My mother had read me the ballad-legend of it
in my boyhood, and I had learned it by heart.&nbsp; Indeed, I can
still recall it after sixty years:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who can tell me where Weinsberg lies?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As brave a town as any;<br />
It must have sheltered in its time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave wives and maidens many:<br />
If e&rsquo;er I wooing have to do,<br />
Good faith, in Weinsberg I will woo!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when we are there,&rdquo; said R&uuml;cker,
&ldquo;we will call <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>on an old friend of my
father&rsquo;s, named Justinus Kerner.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did a Jew ever hear of Moses, or an American of General
Washington?&nbsp; In five minutes I convinced my friend that I
knew more about Kerner than he himself did.&nbsp; Whereupon it
was decided that we should set forth on the following
morning.</p>
<p>Blessed, beautiful, happy summer mornings in
Suabia&mdash;green mounts and grey rocks with old
castles&mdash;peasants harvesting hay&mdash;a <i>Kirchweih</i>,
or peasant&rsquo;s merry-making, with dancing and
festivity&mdash;till we came to Weinsberg, and forthwith called
on the ancient sage, whom we found with the two or three ladies
and gentlemen of his family.&nbsp; I saw at a glance that they
had the air of aristocracy.&nbsp; He received us very kindly, and
invited us to come to dinner and sup with him.</p>
<p>The Weibertreue is an old castle which was in or at the end of
Dr. Kerner&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; Once, when all the town had
taken refuge in it from the Emperor Conrad, the latter gave the
women leave to quit the fort, and also permission to every one to
carry with her whatever was unto her most valuable, precious, or
esteemed.&nbsp; And so the dames went forth, every one bearing on
her back her husband.</p>
<p>In the tower of the castle, or in its wall, which was six feet
thick, were eight or ten windows, gradually opening like
trumpets, through which the wind blew all the time, and
pleasantly enough on a hot summer day.&nbsp; In each of these the
Doctor had placed an &AElig;olian harp, and he who did not
believe in fairies or the gentle spirit of a viewless sound
should have sat in that tower and listened to the music as it
rose and fell, as in endless solemn glees or part-singing; one
harp stepping in, and pealing out richly and strangely as another
died away, while anon, even as the new voice came, there thrilled
in unison one or two more Ariels who seemed to be hurrying up to
join the song.&nbsp; It was a marvellous strange thing of beauty,
which resounded, indeed, all over Germany, for men spoke of it
far and wide.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Quite as marvellous, in the evening, was the
Doctor&rsquo;s own performance on the single and double
Jew&rsquo;s harp.&nbsp; From this most unpromising instrument he
drew airs of such exquisite beauty that one could not have been
more astonished had he heard the sweet tones of Grisi drawn from
a cat by twisting its tail.&nbsp; But we were in a land of
marvels and wonders, or, as an English writer described it,
&ldquo;Weinsberg, a place on the Neckar, inhabited partly by men
and women&mdash;some in and some out of the body&mdash;and partly
by ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were visions in the air, and dreams
sitting on the staircases; in fact, when I saw the peasants
working in the fields, I should not have been astonished to see
them vanish into mist or sink into the ground.</p>
<p>And yet from the ruined castle of the Weibertreue Kerner
pointed out to us a man walking along the road, and that man was
the very incarnation of all that was sober, rational, and
undream-like; for it was David Strauss, author of the &ldquo;Life
of Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at him too I gazed with the awe due to
a great man whose name is known to all the cultured world; and to
me much more than the name; for I had read, as before mentioned,
his &ldquo;Life of Jesus&rdquo; when I first went to
Princeton.</p>
<p>Dr. Kerner took to me greatly, and said that I very much
reminded him, in appearance and conversation, of what his most
intimate friend, Ludwig Uhland, had been at my age; and as he
repeated this several times, and spoke of it long after to
friends, I think it must have been true, although I am compelled
to admit that people who pride themselves on looking like this or
that celebrity never resemble him in the least, mentally or
spiritually, and are generally only mere caricatures at best.</p>
<p>On our return we climbed into an old Gothic church-tower, in
which I found a fifteenth-century bell, bearing the words,
<i>Vivas voco</i>, <i>mortuos plango</i>, <i>fulgura</i>
<i>frango</i>, and much more&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dead I knell, the living wake,<br />
And the power of lightning break!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>which caused me to reflect on the vast degree to which
all the minor uses and observances of the Church&mdash;which are
nine-tenths of all their religion to the multitude&mdash;were
only old heathen superstitious in new dresses.&nbsp; The bell was
a spell against the demons of lightning in old Etrurian days; to
this time the Tuscan peasant bears one in the darkening
twilight-tide to drive away the witches flitting round: in him
and them &ldquo;those evening bells&rdquo; inspired a deeper
sentiment than poetry.</p>
<p>In a village, R&uuml;cker, finding the beer very good, bought
a cask of it, which was put on board the little Neckar steamboat
on which we returned to Heidelberg.&nbsp; And thus provided, the
next evening he gave a &ldquo;barty&rdquo; up in the old castle,
among the ruins by moonlight, where I &ldquo;assisted,&rdquo; and
the <i>lager</i> was devoured, even to the last drop.</p>
<p>I soon grew tired of the family dinners with the Frau
Inspectorinn and the Herr Inspector with the <i>one</i> tumbler
of Neckar wine, which I was expected not to exceed; so I removed
my dining to the &ldquo;Court of Holland,&rdquo; a first-class
hotel, where O. and the other Americans met, and where the
expectation was not that a man should by any means limit himself
to one glass, but that, taking at least one to begin with, he
should considerably exceed it.&nbsp; This hotel was kept by a man
named Spitz, who looked his name to perfection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Er spitzt betr&uuml;bt die Nase,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Scheffel wrote of him in his poem, <i>Numero Acht</i>, the
scene of which is laid in the &ldquo;Court of
Holland.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here a word about Scheffel.&nbsp; During
the following semester he was for months a daily table-companion
of mine at the Bremer-Eck, where a small circle of
students&mdash;<i>quorum pars fui</i>&mdash;met every evening to
sup and <i>kneip</i>, or to drink beer and smoke and sing until
eleven.&nbsp; Little did I dream in those days that he would
become the great popular poet of his time, or that I should ever
translate his <i>Gaudeamus</i>.&nbsp; I owe the &ldquo;Court of
Holland&rdquo; to this day for a dinner and a bottle of
wine.&nbsp; <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>It is the only debt I owe, to my
knowledge, to anybody on earth.</p>
<p>It was resolved among the Americans that we should all make a
foot-excursion with knapsacks down the Rhine to Cologne.&nbsp; It
was done.&nbsp; So we went gaily from town to town, visiting
everything, making excursions inland now and then.&nbsp; We had a
bottle or two of the best Johannisberg in the very Schloss
itself&mdash;<i>omne cum pr&aelig;tio</i>&mdash;and meeting with
such adventures as befell all wandering students in those
old-fashioned, merry times.&nbsp; The Rhine was wild as yet, and
not paved, swept, garnished and full of modern villas and
adornment, as now.&nbsp; I had made, while in America, a
manuscript book of the places and legends of and on the Rhine,
with many drawings.&nbsp; This, and a small volume of
Snow&rsquo;s and Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legends of the
Rhine,&rdquo; I carried with me.&nbsp; I was already well
informed as to every village and old ruin or tower on the
banks.</p>
<p>So we arrived at Cologne, and saw all the sights.&nbsp; The
cathedral was not then finished, and the town still boasted its
two-and-seventy stinks, as counted by Coleridge.&nbsp; Then we
returned by steamer to Mainz, and thence footed it home.</p>
<p>Little by little I rather fell away from my American friends,
and began to take to German or English associates, and especially
to the company of two Englishmen.&nbsp; One was named Leonard
Field, who is now a lawyer in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields; the
other was Ewan P. Colquhoun, a younger brother of Sir Patrick
Colquhoun, whom I knew well, and as friend, in after years, until
his recent death.&nbsp; I always, however, maintained a great
intimacy with George Ward, of Boston, who became long after a
banker and Baring&rsquo;s agent in America.&nbsp; In one way and
another these two twined into my life in after years, and led to
my making many acquaintances or friends.</p>
<p>I walked a great deal all about Heidelberg to many very
picturesque places, maintaining deep interest in all I saw by
much loving reading of <i>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</i> and <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Uhland&rsquo;s collection of old German songs&mdash;his
own poems I knew long before&mdash;the <i>Nibelungen</i> and
<i>Hero-Book</i>, and a great variety of other works.&nbsp; I had
dropped the Occulta, and for a year or two read nothing of the
kind except casually the works of Eckhartshausen and Justinus
Kerner.&nbsp; I can now see that, as I became healthy and strong,
owing to the easy, pleasant existence which I led, it was best
for me after all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grappling with life&rdquo; and
earnestly studying a profession then might have extinguished
me.&nbsp; My mental spring, though not broken, was badly bent,
and it required a long time to straighten it.</p>
<p>Colquhoun was only eighteen, but far beyond his years in
dissipation, and well-nigh advanced to cool cynicism.&nbsp; With
him I made many an excursion all about the country.&nbsp;
Wherever a <i>Kirclweih</i> or peasants&rsquo; ball was to be
held, he always knew of it, and there we went.&nbsp; One morning
early he came to my rooms.&nbsp; There was to be a really
stunning duel fought early between a Senior and some very
illustrious <i>Schl&auml;ger</i>, and he had two English friends
named Burnett who would go with us.&nbsp; So we went, and meeting
with R&uuml;cker at the <i>Pawkboden</i>, it was proposed that we
should go on together to Baden-Baden.&nbsp; To which I objected
that I had only twenty florins in my pocket, and had no time to
return home for more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said
Colquhoun; &ldquo;R&uuml;cker has plenty of money; we can borrow
from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went to Baden and to the first hotel, and had a fine
dinner, and saw the Burnetts off.&nbsp; Then, of course, to the
gaming-table, where Colquhoun speedily lost all his money, and I
so much that I had but ten florins left.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind;
we&rsquo;ll pump on R&uuml;cker,&rdquo; said Colquhoun.</p>
<p>We went up to visit the old castle.&nbsp; While there,
R&uuml;cker took off his overcoat, in which he had his
pocket-book, and laid it over a chair.&nbsp; When we returned to
the hotel the pocket-book was gone!&nbsp; There we were, with a
hotel-bill to pay and never a cent wherewith to pay it.&nbsp; I
had, however, still ten florins.&nbsp; Colquhoun suddenly
remembered that he <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>had seen something in the town,
price ten florins, which he <i>must</i> buy.&nbsp; It was
something which he had promised to buy for a relative in
England.&nbsp; It was a very serious case of necessity.</p>
<p>I doubted my dear friend, but having sworn him by all his gods
that he would <i>not</i> gamble with the money, I gave it to
him.&nbsp; So he, of course, went straight to the gaming-table,
and, having luck, won enough to pay our debt and take us
home.</p>
<p>I should mention that R&uuml;cker went up to the castle and
found his pocket-book with all the money.&nbsp; &ldquo;For not
only doth Fortune favour the bold,&rdquo; as is written in my
great unpublished romance of &ldquo;Flaxius the Immortal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;but, while her hand is in, also helps their friends with
no unsparing measure, as is marvellously confirmed by
Machiavelli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vacation came.&nbsp; My friends scattered far and wide.&nbsp;
I joined with three German friends and one Frenchman, and we
strapped on our knapsacks for a foot-journey into
Switzerland.&nbsp; First we went to Freiburg in Baden, and saw
the old Cathedral, and so on, singing, and stopping to drink, and
meeting with other students from other universities, and resting
in forests, amid mountains, by roaring streams, and entering
cottages and chatting with girls.&nbsp; <i>Hurra</i>! <i>frei ist
der bursch</i>!</p>
<p>One afternoon we walked sixteen miles through a rain which was
like a waterfall.&nbsp; I was so drenched that it was with
difficulty I kept my passport and letter of exchange from being
ruined.&nbsp; When we came out of the storm there were <i>six</i>
of us!&nbsp; Another student had, unseen, joined our party in the
rain, and I had never noticed it!</p>
<p>We came to a tavern at the foot of the Rigiberg.&nbsp; My pack
was soaked.&nbsp; One friend lent me a shirt, another a pair of
drawers, and we wrapped ourselves in sheets from the beds and
called for brandy and water hot&mdash;a pleasing novelty to the
Germans&mdash;and so went to bed.&nbsp; The next day <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>we
ascended the Rigi; found many students there; did not see the sun
rise in the morning, but still a mighty panorama, wondrous fair,
and so walked down again.&nbsp; And receiving my carpet-bag at
Lucerne, whither I had had the precaution to send one, I dressed
myself again in clean linen and went back to Germany.&nbsp; I
meant to travel more in Switzerland, but it was very rainy that
year, and, as it proved, I did wisely.</p>
<p>I returned to Spitz, but his house was full of English, and he
informed me, rather exultantly and foolishly, that he had no room
for me, and could not tell me where to go, &ldquo;every place was
full.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I had spent money freely with him I did not
like it.&nbsp; The head-waiter followed me out and recommended
the Black Eagle, kept by Herr Lehr.&nbsp; There I went, got a
good room, and for months after dined daily at its
<i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; I sent friends there, and
returned to the house with my wife twenty years later.&nbsp; My
brother also went there long after, and endeared himself to all,
helping Herr Lehr to plant his vines.&nbsp; In after years Herr
Lehr had forgotten me, but not my brother.&nbsp; Lehr&rsquo;s son
was a gentlemanly young fellow, well educated.&nbsp; He became a
captain, and was the first officer killed in the Franco-German
war.</p>
<p>Vacation passed, and the students returned and lectures were
resumed.&nbsp; There was a grand <i>Commers</i> or
students&rsquo; supper meeting at which I was present; and again
the duelling-ground rang with the sound of blades, and all was
merry as before.&nbsp; Herr Zimmer, the University
dancing-master, gave lessons and cotillion or waltzing-parties
thrice a week, and these I regularly attended.&nbsp; Those who
came to them were the daughters of the humbler professors and
respectable shopkeepers.&nbsp; During the previous session I had
taken lessons from a little old Frenchman, who brought his fiddle
and a pretty daughter twice a week to my room, where, with Ward,
we formed a class of three.</p>
<p>This gentleman was a perfect type&mdash;fit to be staged
without a touch of change&mdash;of the old <i>emigr&eacute;</i>,
who has now vanished, even from among the French.&nbsp; His bows,
his wit&mdash;<i>la </i><!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span><i>grace
extra&rsquo;ordinaire</i>&mdash;the intonations of his voice, and
his vivacity, were beyond the art of any actor now living.&nbsp;
There were many more peculiar and marked types of character in
the last generation than now exist, when Everybody is becoming
Everybody else with such fearful rapidity.</p>
<p>There were four great masked balls held in Heidelberg during
the winter, each corresponding to a special state of
society.&nbsp; That at the Museum or great University Club was
patronised by the <i>elite</i> of nobility and the professors and
their families.&nbsp; Then came the
<i>Harmonie</i>&mdash;respectable, but not aristocratic.&nbsp;
Then another in a hotel, which was rather more rowdy than
reputable; not really outrageous, yet where the gentlemen
students &ldquo;whooped it up&rdquo; in grand style with
congenial grisettes; and, finally, there was a fancy ball at the
Waldhorn, or some such place, or several of them, over the river,
where peasants and students with maids to match could waltz once
round the vast hall for a penny till stopped by a cordon of
robust rustics.&nbsp; We thought it great fun with our partners
to waltz impetuously and bump with such force against the barrier
as to break through, in which case we were not only greatly
admired, but got another waltz gratis.&nbsp; We had wild
peasant-dancing in abundance, and the consumption of wine and
beer was something awful.</p>
<p>One morning a German student named Gr&uuml;ner, who had been
at Jena, came to my room with a brilliant proposition.&nbsp; We
should go to Frankfort and hear Jenny Lind sing in her great
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Norma.&nbsp; I had already heard her sing in
concert in Heidelberg&mdash;where, by the way, the students
rushed into her room as soon as she had left, and tore to strips
the bed in which she had slept, and carried them away for
souvenirs, to the great amazement of an old Englishman who had
just been put into the room.&nbsp; (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;I was not
in the party.)&nbsp; I objected that it was getting to the end of
the month, and that I had not money enough for such an
outing.&nbsp; To which he replied, that we could go on to
Homburg, and make money enough at <i>rouge-et-noir</i> to cover
all expenses.&nbsp; <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>This obvious and admirable method of
raising funds had not occurred to me, so I agreed to go.</p>
<p>We went to Frankfort, and heard the greatly overrated Jenny
Lind, and the next day proceeded to Hamburg, and at once to the
green table.&nbsp; Here I lost a little, but Gr&uuml;ner made so
much, that on returning to the table I took from it a sufficient
sum to cover all our expenses, and told him that, come what
might, it must remain untouched, and gave him the
remainder.&nbsp; That afternoon I played for five-franc pieces,
and at one time had both my side-pockets so full that they
weighed very heavily.&nbsp; And these again I lost.&nbsp; Then
Gr&uuml;ner lost all his, and came imploring me for more, but I
would not give him a <i>kreutzer</i>.&nbsp; Matters were
beginning to look serious.&nbsp; I had a reserved fund of perhaps
fifty napoleons, which I kept for dire need or accidents.&nbsp;
That evening I observed a man who had great luck, winning twice
out of three times.&nbsp; I watched his play, and as soon as he
lost I set a napoleon&mdash;by which I won enough to clear my
expenses, and buy me, moreover, a silver-headed cane, a gold
watch-chain, and two Swiss watches.&nbsp; I may mention by the
way, that since that day I have never played at anything, save
losing a ten-franc piece in after years at Wiesbaden.</p>
<p>There dined very often at our <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>
in the Adler an old German lady named Helmine von Ch&eacute;zy,
who had a reputation as a poetess.&nbsp; With her I sometimes
conversed.&nbsp; One day she narrated in full what she declared
was the true story of Caspar H&auml;user.&nbsp; Unto her Heine
had addressed the epigram&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Helmine von Ch&eacute;zy,<br />
Geborene Klencke,<br />
Ich bitte Sie, geh&rsquo; Sie<br />
Mit ihrer Po&eacute;sie,<br />
Sonst kriegt Sie die Kr&auml;nke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helmine von Ch&eacute;zy,<br />
Born Klencke, I pray<br />
With your pestilent poems<br />
You&rsquo;ll hasten away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>There was also an elderly and very pleasant Englishman,
with whom I became rather intimate, and who was very kind to
me.&nbsp; This was the well-known Captain Medwin, who had known
so well Byron, Shelley, Trelawny, and their compeers.&nbsp; He
was full of anecdotes, which I now wish that I had
recorded.&nbsp; He introduced me to Lady Caroline de Crespigny,
who was then living permanently in Heidelberg.&nbsp; This lady,
who was said to be then fifty years of age, was still so
young-looking and beautiful, that I cannot remember in all my
life to have ever seen such an instance of time arrested.&nbsp; I
also made the acquaintance of Professor Creutzer, author of the
<i>Symbolik</i>, a work of vast learning. <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a>&nbsp; And I went to balls, one at
Professor Gervinus&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I entered myself with the great Leopold Gmelin for a course of
lectures on chemistry, and worked away every morning with the
test-tubes at analytical chemistry under Professor Posselt, at
which I one day nearly poisoned myself by tasting oxalic acid,
which I did not recognise under its German name of
<i>Klees&auml;ure</i>.&nbsp; I read broad and wide in German
literature, as I think may be found by examining my notes to my
translation of Heine&rsquo;s works, and went with Field several
times to Frankfort, to attend the theatre, and otherwise amuse
ourselves.&nbsp; There I once made the acquaintance of the very
famous comic actor Hasselt.&nbsp; He was a grave, almost
melancholy man when off the stage, very fond of arch&aelig;ology
and antiquities.</p>
<p>The winter drew to an end.&nbsp; I had long felt a deep desire
to visit Munich, to study art, and to investigate fundamentally
the wonderful and mysterious science of &AElig;sthetics, of which
I had heard so much.&nbsp; So I packed up and paid my bills, and
passing through one town where there was in the hotel where I
stopped, the last wolf ever killed in Germany, <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>and freshly
killed (I believe he has been slain two or three times since),
and at another where I was invited to see a criminal beheaded by
the sword&mdash;which sight I missed by over-sleeping
myself&mdash;I came through Stuttgart, Ulm, and Augsburg to the
German Athens.</p>
<p>I went to the H&ocirc;tel Maulick, where I stayed a
week.&nbsp; Opposite to me at table every day sat the famous
Saphir, the great Vienna wit and licensed joker.&nbsp; Of course
I soon became acquainted with some students, and was entered at
the University, and got the card which exempted me from being
arrested by any save the University beadles.&nbsp; I believe that
we even had our own hangman, but as none of my friends ever had
occasion for his services I did not inquire.&nbsp; The same
ticket also entitled me to attend the opera at half-price, and if
it had only included tobacco and beer gratis, it would have been
the means of vast economies.</p>
<p>I entered myself for a course of lectures by Professor
Friedrich Thiersch on &AElig;sthetics.&nbsp; He it was who had
trained Heine to art, and I venture to say that in my case the
seed fell on good ground.&nbsp; I took in every thought.&nbsp;
His system agreed, on the whole, perfectly with that advanced in
after years by Taine, and marvellously well with that set forth
in the &ldquo;Essays, Speculative and Suggestive,&rdquo; of J. A.
Symonds&mdash;that is, it was eclectic and deductive from
historical periods, and not at all &ldquo;rhapsodical&rdquo; or
merely subjective.&nbsp; I bought the best works, such as
Kugler&rsquo;s, for guides, and studied hard, and frequented the
Pinacothek and Glyptothek, and I may say really educated myself
well in the history of art and different schools of
&aelig;sthetics.&nbsp; My previous reading, travel, and tastes
fitted me in every way to easily master such knowledge.&nbsp; I
also followed Becker&rsquo;s course on Schelling, but my heart
was not in it, as it would have been two years before.&nbsp; The
lectures of Professor Henry and Gmelin and true Science had
caused in me a distrust of metaphysics and psychological systems
and theories.&nbsp; I began to see that they were all only very
ingenious shufflings and combinations and <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>phases of
the same old cards of Pantheism, which could be made into Theism,
Pietism, Atheism, or Materialism to suit any taste.&nbsp; I was
advancing rapidly to pure science, though Evolution was as yet
unknown by the name, albeit the Okenites and others with their
<i>Natur-philosophie</i> were coming closely to it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it may be truly said that, as regarded
deducing man and all things from a <i>prima materia</i> or
protoplasm by means of natural selection and vast study of
differentiation, they were exactly where Darwin, and Wallace, and
Huxley were when we began to know the latter.&nbsp; I do not
agree with Max M&uuml;ller in his very German and very artfully
disguised and defended theory that the religious idea originated
in a vague sense of the Infinite in the minds of savages; for I
believe it began with the bogeys and nightmares of obscure
terror, hunger, disease, and death; but the Professor is quite
right in declaring that Evolution was first created or developed
in the German <i>Natur-philosophie</i>, the true beginning of
which was with the Italian naturalists, such as Bruno and De
Cusa.&nbsp; What is to be observed is this, yet few understand
it, nor has even Symonds cleared the last barrier&mdash;that when
a Pantheist has got so far as to conceive an identity between
matter and spirit, while on the other hand a scientific
materialist rises to the unity of spirit and matter, there is
nothing to choose between them.&nbsp; Only this is true, that the
English Evolutionists, by abandoning reasoning based on
Pantheistic poetic bases, as in Schelling&rsquo;s case, or purely
logical, as in Hegel&rsquo;s, and by proceeding on plainly
prosaic, merely material, simply scientific grounds after the
example of Bacon, swept away so much rubbish that people no
longer recognised the old temple of Truth, and really thought it
was a brand new workshop or laboratory.&nbsp; But I can remember
very distinctly that to me Evolution did <i>not</i> come as if I
had received a new soul, or even a new body, but had merely had a
bath, and put on new garments.&nbsp; And as I became an English
Evolutionist in due time, I had this great advantage, that <!--
page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>by beginning so young I succeeded in doing very
thoroughly what Symonds and Maudsley and many more clearly
understand is <i>most</i> difficult&mdash;that is, not merely to
accept the truth, but to get rid of the old <i>associations</i>
of the puzzle of a difference between spirit and matter, which
thing caused even the former to muddle about &ldquo;God,&rdquo;
and express disgust at &ldquo;Materialism,&rdquo; and declare
that there is &ldquo;an insoluble problem,&rdquo; which is all in
flat contradiction to pure Evolution, which does not meddle with
&ldquo;the Unknowable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a Jewish professor named Karl Friedrich Neumann, who
was about as many-sided a man as could be found even in a German
university.&nbsp; He was a great Chinese scholar&mdash;had been
in China, and also read on mathematics and modern history.&nbsp;
I attended these lectures (not the mathematics) and liked them:
so we became acquainted.&nbsp; I found that he had written a very
interesting little work on the visit recorded in the Chinese
annals of certain Buddhist monks to Fusang&mdash;probably
Mexico&mdash;in the fifth century.&nbsp; I proposed to translate
it, and did so, he making emendations and adding fresh matter to
the English version.</p>
<p>Professor Neumann was a vigorous reader, but he soon found
that I was of the same kind.&nbsp; One day he lent me a large
work on some Indian subject, and the next I brought it
back.&nbsp; He said that I could not have read it in the
time.&nbsp; I begged him to examine me on it, which he did, and
expressed his amazement, for he declared that he had never met
with anything like it in all his life.&nbsp; This from him was
praise indeed.&nbsp; Long after, in America, George Boker in
closer fashion tested me on this without my knowing it, and
published the result in an article.</p>
<p>I became acquainted with a learned writer on art named
Foerster, who had married a daughter of Jean Paul Richter, and
dined once or twice at his house.&nbsp; I also saw him twenty
years later in Munich.&nbsp; George Ward came in from Berlin to
stay some weeks in Munich.&nbsp; I saw Taglioni several times at
the opera, but did not make her acquaintance till 1870.&nbsp; The
<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>great, tremendous celebrity at that time in Munich was
also an opera-dancer, though not on the stage.&nbsp; This was
Lola Montez, the King&rsquo;s last favourite.&nbsp; He had had
all his mistresses painted, one by one, and the gallery was open
to the public.&nbsp; Lola&rsquo;s was the last, and there was a
blank space still left <i>for a few more</i>.&nbsp; I thought
that about twenty-five would complete the collection.</p>
<p>Lola Montez had a small palace, and was raised to be the
Countess of Landsfeldt, but this was not enough.&nbsp; She wished
to run the whole kingdom and government, and kick out the
Jesuits, and kick up the devil, generally speaking.&nbsp; But the
Jesuits and the mob were too much for her.&nbsp; I knew her very
well in later years in America, when she deeply regretted that I
had not called on her in Munich.&nbsp; I must have had a great
moral influence on her, for, so far as I am aware, I am the only
friend whom she ever had at whom she never threw a plate or book,
or attacked with a dagger, poker, broom, chair, or other deadly
weapon.&nbsp; We were both born at the same time in the same
year, and I find by the rules of sorcery that she is the first
person who will meet me when I go to heaven.&nbsp; I always had a
great and strange respect for her singular talents; there were
very few indeed, if any there were, who really knew the depths of
that wild Irish soul.&nbsp; Men generally were madly fascinated
with her, then as suddenly disenchanted, and then detracted from
her in every way.</p>
<p>There were many adventuresses in later years who passed
themselves about the world for Lola Montez.&nbsp; I have met with
two friends, whom I am sure were honest gentlemen, who told me
they had known her intimately.&nbsp; Both described her as a
large, powerful, or robust woman.&nbsp; Lola was in reality very
small, pale, and thin, or <i>fr&eacute;le</i>, with beautiful
blue eyes and curly black hair.&nbsp; She was a typical beauty,
with a face full of character, and a person of remarkably great
and varied reading.&nbsp; One of her most intimate friends was
wont to tell her that she and I had many very strange
characteristics in common, which we shared with no one else, <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>while we differed utterly in other respects.&nbsp; It
was very like both of us, for Lola, when defending the existence
of the soul against an atheist, to tumble over a great trunk of
books of the most varied kind, till she came to an old
vellum-bound copy of Apuleius, and proceed to establish her views
according to his subtle Neo-Platonism.&nbsp; But she romanced and
embroidered so much in conversation that she did not get credit
for what she really knew.</p>
<p>I once met with a literary man in New York who told me he had
long desired to make my acquaintance, because he had heard her
praise me so immeasurably beyond anybody else she had ever known,
that he wanted to see what manner of man I could be.&nbsp; I
heard the same from another, in another place long after.&nbsp;
Once she proposed to me to make a bolt with her to Europe, which
I declined.&nbsp; The secret of my influence was that I always
treated her with respect, and never made love or flirted.</p>
<p>An intimate of both of us who was present when this friendly
proposal was made remarked with some astonishment, &ldquo;But,
Madame, by what means can you two <i>live</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Lola innocently and confidingly,
&ldquo;people like us&rdquo; (or &ldquo;who know as much as
we&rdquo;) &ldquo;can get a living anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
rolled us each a cigarette, with one for herself.&nbsp; I could
tell a number of amusing tales of this Queen of Bohemia, but
Space, the Kantean god, forbids me more.&nbsp; But I may say that
I never had more really congenial and wide-embracing
conversations with any human being in my life than with Her
Majesty.&nbsp; There was certainly no topic, within my range, at
least, on which she could not converse with some substance of
personal experience and reading.&nbsp; She had a mania for
meeting and knowing all kinds of peculiar people.</p>
<p>I lived in the main street near the Karlsthor, opposite a
tavern called the Ober-Pollinger, which was a medi&aelig;val
tavern in those days.&nbsp; My landlady was a nice old soul, and
she had two daughters, one of whom was a beauty, and as <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>gentle and Germanly good as a girl could be.&nbsp; Her
face still lives in a great picture by a great artist.&nbsp; We
lived on the third floor; on the ground was a shop, in which
cutlery and some fireworks were sold.&nbsp; It befell that George
Ward and I were very early in the morning sitting on a bench
before the Ober-Pollinger, waiting for a stage-coach, which would
take us to some place out of town; when bang! bang! crack! I
heard a noise in the firework shop, and saw explosions puffing
smoke out of the bursting windows.&nbsp; Great God! the front
shop was on fire; it was full of fireworks, such as rockets and
crackers, and I knew there was a barrel of gunpowder in the
back-shop!&nbsp; I had found it out a few days before, when I
went there to buy some for my pistols.&nbsp; And the family were
asleep.&nbsp; In an instant I tore across the street, rushed
screaming upstairs, roused them all out of bed, howling,
&ldquo;It burns!&mdash;there&rsquo;s gunpowder!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet,
hurried as I was, I caught up a small hand-bag, which contained
my money, as I got the girls and their mother downstairs.&nbsp; I
was just in time to see a gigantic butcher burst open the
two-inch door with an axe, and roll out the barrel containing two
hundred pounds of gunpowder, as the flames were licking it.&nbsp;
I saw them distinctly.</p>
<p>It was the awful row which I made which had brought the people
out betimes, including the butcher and his axe.&nbsp; But for
that, there would have been a fearful blow-up.&nbsp; But the
butcher showed himself a man of gold on this occasion, for he it
was who really saved us all.&nbsp; A day or two after, when I was
jesting about myself as a knightly rescuer of forlorn damsels, in
reply to some remark on the event, George Ward called me to
order.&nbsp; There was, as he kindly said, too much that he
respected in that event to make fun of it.</p>
<p>George Ward is deeply impressed on my memory.&nbsp; He was a
sedate young fellow, with a gift of dry humour, now and then
expressed in quaint remarks, a gentleman in every instinct, much
given to reading and reflecting.&nbsp; When he <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>said
anything, he meant it, and this remark of his struck me more than
the event itself had done.</p>
<p>And to think that I quite forgot, in narrating my Princeton
experiences, to tell of something very much like this
incident.&nbsp; It was in my last year, and my landlady had just
moved into a new house, when, owing to some defect in the
building, it caught fire, but was luckily saved after it had
received some damage.&nbsp; I awoke in the night, flames bursting
into my room, and much smoke.&nbsp; It happened that the day
before a friend in Alabama had sent me eleven hundred dollars
wherewith to pay for him certain debts.&nbsp; My first thought
was for this money, so I hurried to get the key of the secretary
in which it was&mdash;keys never can be found in a
hurry&mdash;and when found, I could not find the right one in the
bunch.&nbsp; And then it stuck in the lock and would not open it,
till finally I succeeded and got the money out.&nbsp; And then,
not finding myself quite dead, I in a hurry turned the contents
of three drawers in my bureau and my linen on to the bed, threw
on it my coats and trousers, tied the four corners of a sheet
together in one bundle, caught up my boots, fencing-foils,
&amp;c., to make another, and so rescued all I had.&nbsp; I
verily believe I did it all in one minute.&nbsp; That day the
President, old Dr. Carnahan, when I plead &ldquo;not
prepared&rdquo; for failing at recitation, excused me with a grim
smile.&nbsp; I had really that time some excuse for it.&nbsp;
During the Munich incident I thought of the sheets.&nbsp; But I
had gunpowder and two girls to look after in the latter place,
and time and tide&mdash;or gunpowder and girls&mdash;wait for no
man.</p>
<p>And so, with study and art and friends, and much terrible
drinking of beer and smoking of Varinas-Kanaster, and roaming at
times in gay greenwoods with pretty maids alway, and music and
dancing, the Munich semester came to an end.&nbsp; I proposed to
travel with an English friend named Pottinger to Vienna, and
thence by some adventurous route or other through Germany to
Paris; which was a great deal more to undertake in those days
than it now is, entailing several <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>hundred per
cent. more pain and sorrow, fasting, want of sleep and washing,
than any man would encounter in these days in going round the
world and achieving <i>la grande route</i>; or the common
European tour, to boot.&nbsp; For it befell me ere I reached my
journey&rsquo;s end to pass eighteen nights in one month in
Eilwagen or waggons, the latter being sometimes without
springs.&nbsp; And once or twice or thrice I was so utterly worn
and wearied that I slept all night, though I was so tossed about
that I awoke in the morning literally bruised from head to foot,
with my chimney-pot hat under my feet; which was worse than even
a forced march on short commons&mdash;as I found in after
years&mdash;or driving in a Russian <i>telega</i>, or jackassing
in Egypt, or any other of the trifles over which pampered
tourists make such heart-rending howls now-a-days.</p>
<p>So we went to Prague, and thence to Vienna, which, in the year
1847, was a very different place indeed to what it is at present;
for an unbounded gaiety and an air of reckless festivity was
apparent then all the time to everybody everywhere.&nbsp; Under
it all lurked and rankled abuses, municipal, social, and
political, such as would in 1893 be deemed incredible if not
unnatural (as may be read in a clever novel called <i>Die
sch&ouml;ne Wienerinn</i>), but on the surface all was brilliant
foam and sunshine and laughing sirens.&nbsp; What new thing
Strauss would play in the evening was the great event of the
day.&nbsp; I saw and heard the great Johann Strauss&mdash;this
was the grandfather&mdash;and in after years his son, and the
<i>sch&ouml;ne Edie</i> his grandson.&nbsp; Everywhere one heard
music, and the Prater was a gay and festive paradise
indeed.&nbsp; There was no business; the town lived on the
Austrian, Hungarian, Bohemian, Russian, and other nobility, who
in those days were extravagant and ostentatious to a degree now
undreamed of, and on strangers.&nbsp; As for free and easy
licentiousness, Paris was a trifle to it, and the police had
strict orders to encourage everything of the kind; the result
being that the seventh commandment in all its phases was treated
like pie-crust, as <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>a thing made to be broken, the
oftener the better.&nbsp; Even on our first arriving at our
hotel, our good-natured landlord, moved by the principle that it
was not good for a young man to be alone, informed us that if we
wished to have damsels in our rooms no objection would be
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is
not a church&rdquo;; the obvious inference being that to a
Viennese every place not a church must necessarily be a temple to
Venus.&nbsp; And every Wiener, when spoken to, roared with
laughter; and there were minstrels in the streets, and musicians
in every dining-place and caf&eacute;, and great ringing of bells
in chimes, and &rsquo;twas merry in hall when beards wagged all,
and &ldquo;the world went very well in those days.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Vienna is a far finer town now, but it is a Quaker meeting-house
compared to what it was for gaiety forty years ago.</p>
<p>This change of life and manners has spread, and will continue
to spread, all over the world.&nbsp; In feudal times the people
were kept quiet by means of holidays, carnivals, processions,
fairs, fairy-tales, treats, and indulgences; even the common
childish instinct for gay dress and picturesqueness of appearance
was encouraged, and at high tides everybody was fed and given to
drink: so that if the poor toiled and fasted and prayed, it might
be for months, they had their joyous revellings to anticipate,
when there were free tables even for strangers.&nbsp; In those
days&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Christmas banquet oft would cheer<br />
A poor man&rsquo;s heart for half the year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Middle Age lasted effectively until the epoch of the
Revolution and railroads, or, to fix a date, till about
1848.&nbsp; And then all at once, as at a breath, it all
disappeared, and now lives, so to speak, only in holes and
corners.&nbsp; For as soon as railroads came, factories sprang up
and Capital began to employ Labour, and Labour to plot and
combine against Capital; and what with scientific inventions and
a sudden stimulus to labour, and newspapers, the multitude got
beyond fancy dresses and the being amused to keep them quiet like
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>children, and so the <i>juventus mundi</i> passed
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a perfect <i>shame</i>!&rdquo; say the
dear young lady tourists, &ldquo;that the peasantry no longer
wear their beautiful dresses; they ought to be <i>obliged</i> to
keep them up.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But how would <i>you</i> like,
my dear, if you were of the lower orders, to wear a dress which
proclaimed it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the conversation ceaseth, for it
becomes too deep for the lady tourist to follow.</p>
<p>How it was we wandered I do not distinctly remember, but
having visited Nuremberg, Prague, and Dresden, we went to
Breslau, where a fancy seized us to go to Cracow.&nbsp; True, we
had not a special <i>vis&eacute;</i> from a Russian minister to
enter the Muscovite dominions, but the police at Breslau, who (as
I was afterwards told) loved to make trouble for those on the
frontier, bade us be of good cheer and cheek it out, neither to
be afraid of any man, and to go ahead bravely.&nbsp; Which we
did.</p>
<p>There was a sweet scene at the frontier station on the
Polish-Russian line at about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
when the grim and insolent officials discovered that our
passports had only the police <i>vis&eacute;</i> from
Breslau!&nbsp; I was asked why I had not in my native country
secured the <i>vis&eacute;</i> of a Russian minister; to which I
replied that in America the very existence of such a country as
Russia was utterly unknown, and that I myself was astonished to
find that Russians knew what passports were.&nbsp; Also that I
always supposed that foreigners conferred a great benefit on a
country by spending their money in it; but that if I could not be
admitted, that was an end of it; it was a matter of very trifling
consequence, indeed, for we really did not care twopence whether
we saw Russia or not; a country more or less made very little
difference to such travellers as we were.</p>
<p>Cheek is a fine thing in its way, and on this occasion I
developed enough brass to make a pan, and enough
&ldquo;sass&rdquo; to fill it; but all in vain.&nbsp; When I
visited the Muscovite realm in after years I was more kindly
received.&nbsp; On this occasion we were closely searched and
re-searched, although <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>we were not allowed to go on into
Russia!&nbsp; Every square inch of everything was examined as
with a microscope&mdash;even the small scraps of newspaper in
which soap or such trifles were wrapped were examined, a note
made as to each, and all put under paper-weights; and whatever
was suspected&mdash;as, for instance, books or
pamphlets&mdash;was confiscated, although, as I said, we were
turned back!&nbsp; And this robbery accomplished, we were
informed that the stage-coach, or rather rough post-waggon, in
which we came, would return at five o&rsquo;clock <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and that we could in it go back to
Dresden, and might pass the time till then on a bench outside the
building&mdash;reflecting on our sins!&nbsp; I had truly some
papers about me which I did not care to have examined, but these
were in my cravat, and even Russian ingenuity had not at that
time got beyond picking pockets and feeling the linings of
coats.&nbsp; It has since been suggested to me by something which
I read that I was under suspicion.&nbsp; I had in Munich aided a
Swiss student who was under police surveillance for political
intriguing to escape, by lending him money to get away.&nbsp; It
is probable that for this my passport was marked in a peculiar
manner.&nbsp; My companion, Pottinger, was not much searched; all
suspicion seemed to fall on me.</p>
<p>The stage went on, and Pottinger and I sat on the bench in a
mild drizzle at half-past three in the morning, with as miserable
a country round about as mortal man ever beheld.&nbsp; By-and-bye
one of the subs., a poor Pole, moved by compassion and the hope
of reward, cautiously invited us to come into his den.&nbsp; He
spoke a very little German and a little Latin (Pottinger was an
Oxford man, and knew several heavy classics, Greek and Latin,
perfectly by heart).&nbsp; The Pole had a fire, and we began to
converse.&nbsp; He had heard of America, and that Polish exiles
had been well treated there.&nbsp; I assured him that Poles were
admired and cherished among us like pet lambs among children, and
the adored of the adored.&nbsp; Then I spoke of Russian
oppression, and the Pole, in utmost secrecy, produced a sabre
which had been borne under Kosciusko, <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>and showed
us a silver coin&mdash;utterly prohibited&mdash;which had been
struck during the brief period of the Polish revolution.</p>
<p>The Pole began to prepare <i>his</i> coffee&mdash;for
one.&nbsp; I saw that something must be done to increase the
number of cups.&nbsp; He took up his book of prayers and asked of
what religion we were.&nbsp; Of Pottinger I said contemptuously,
&ldquo;He is nothing but a heretic,&rdquo; but that as for
myself, I had for some time felt a great inclination towards the
<i>Panna</i>&mdash;Holy Virgin&mdash;and that it would afford me
great pleasure to conform to the Polish Catholic Church, but that
unfortunately I did not understand the language.&nbsp; To which
he replied, that if <i>he</i> were to read the morning service in
Polish and I would repeat it word by word, that the <i>Panna</i>
would count it to my credit just as if I had.&nbsp; And as I was
praying in good earnest for a breakfast, I trust that it was
accepted.&nbsp; Down on our knees we went and began our
orisons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leland! you --- humbug!&rdquo; exclaimed Pottinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, you infernal heretic, and don&rsquo;t disturb
Christians at their devotions!&rdquo; was my devout reply.&nbsp;
So, prayers concluded, there <i>was</i> coffee and rolls for
three.&nbsp; And so in due time the coach returned.&nbsp; I
rewarded our host with a thaler, and we returned to Breslau, of
which place I noted that the natives never ate anything but sweet
cakes for their first morning meal.</p>
<p>We stopped at G&ouml;rlitz, where I asked a woman standing in
the half-doorway of the house of Jacob B&ouml;hme if that was his
house.&nbsp; But she had never heard of such a man!</p>
<p>Dresden we thoroughly explored, and were at Leipzig during the
great annual fair.&nbsp; These fairs, in those days, were sights
to behold.&nbsp; Now they are succeeded by stupendous
Expositions, which are far finer and inconceivably greater, yet
which to me lack that kind of gypsy, side-show, droll,
old-fashioned attraction of the ancient gatherings, even as
Barnum&rsquo;s Colossal Moral Show of half-a-dozen circuses at
once and twenty-five elephants does not <i>amuse</i> anybody <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>as the old clown in the ring and one elephant did of
yore.</p>
<p>Thence to Berlin, where we were received with joy by the
American students, who knew all about one another all over
Germany.&nbsp; I very much enjoyed the great art gallery, and the
conversation of those who, like myself, followed lectures on
&AElig;sthetics and the history of art.&nbsp; Thence to Magdeburg
and Hanover, Dusseldorf&mdash;to cut it short, Holland and the
chief cities in Belgium.</p>
<p>I noted one little change of custom in Berlin.&nbsp; In South
Germany it was a common custom for students, when calling on a
friend, to bring and leave generally a small bouquet.&nbsp; When
I did this in Berlin my friends were astonished at it.&nbsp; This
was an old Italian custom, as we may read in the beautiful One
Hundred and Fifty <i>Brindisi</i> or Toasts of Minto.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Porto a voi un fior novello,<br />
Ed, oh come vago e bello!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1847 even a very respectable hotel in Holland was in any
city quite like one of two centuries before.&nbsp; You entered a
long antiquely-brown room, traversed full length by a
table.&nbsp; Before every chair was placed a little metallic dish
with hot coals, and a churchwarden pipe was brought to every
visitor at once without awaiting orders.&nbsp; The stolid,
literal, mechanical action of all the people&rsquo;s minds was
then <i>wonderful</i>.&nbsp; An average German peasant was a
genius compared to these fresh, rosy-fair, well-clad
Hollanders.&nbsp; It was to me a new phase of human happiness in
imbecility, or rather in undisturbed routine; for it is written
that no bird can fly like a bullet and doze or sleep sweetly at
the same time.&nbsp; Yet, as from the Huns, the most hideous
wretches in the world, there arose by intermixture the
Hungarians, who are perhaps the handsomest, so from the
Knickerbocker Dutch sprang the wide-awake New Yorkers!&nbsp; The
galleries in Holland and Belgium were to me joys unutterable and
as the glory of life itself.&nbsp; Munich and Thiersch still
inspired me; <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>I seemed to have found a destiny in
&aelig;sthetics or art, or what had been wanting in Princeton;
that is, how the beautiful entered into life and was developed in
history and made itself felt in all that was worth anything at
all.&nbsp; Modern English writers on this subject&mdash;with
exceptions like that of J. A. Symonds, whose Essays I cannot
commend too highly&mdash;are in the same relation to its grand
truth and higher inspiration as Emerson and Carlyle to Pantheism
in its mightiest early forms.&nbsp; For several years the actual
mastery of &aelig;sthetics gave me great comfort, and advanced me
marvellously in thought to wider and far higher regions.</p>
<p>I forget where I parted with Pottinger; all that I can
remember was, that early in November I arrived alone in Paris,
going to some small hotel or other, and that as all the fatigues
of the past many weeks of weary travel seemed to come upon me all
at once, I went to bed, and never left the house till four
o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the next day.&nbsp;
On the next I found my way into the Latin Quarter, and secured a
<i>not</i> very superior room in the Place Saint-Michel, near the
Ecole de M&eacute;decine, to which I moved my luggage.</p>
<p>I was very much astonished, while sitting alone and rather
blue and overcast in my room, at the sudden entrance of a second
cousin of mine named Frank Fisher, who was studying medicine in
Paris.&nbsp; He had by some odd chance seen my name registered in
the newspapers as having arrived at the hotel, and lost no time
in looking me up.&nbsp; He lived on the other side of the Seine
in the Boule Rouge, near the Rue Helder, a famous happy
hunting-ground for <i>les biches</i>&mdash;I mean kids or the
very dear.&nbsp; I must go forthwith to his quarters and dine,
which I did, and so my introduction to Paris was fairly
begun.</p>
<p>I attended at the Coll&eacute;ge Louis le Grand, and at the
Sorbonne, all or any lectures by everybody, including a very dull
series on German literature by Philarete Ch&acirc;sles.&nbsp; I
read books.&nbsp; <i>Inter alia</i>, I went through Dante&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; in Italian aided by Rivarol&rsquo;s
translation, of which I possessed <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the <i>very
copy</i> stamped with the royal arms, and containing the
author&rsquo;s autograph, which had been presented to the
King.&nbsp; I picked it up on the Quai for a franc, for which sum
I also obtained a first edition of <i>Melusine</i>, which Mr.
Andrew Lang has described as such a delightful rarity.&nbsp; And
I also ran a great deal about town.&nbsp; I saw Rachel, and
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lemaitre, and Mlle. D&eacute;jazet, and
many more at the great theatres, and attended assiduously at
Bobinot&rsquo;s, which was a very small theatre in the Quartier
Latin, frequented entirely by students and grisettes.&nbsp; I
went to many a ball, both great and small, including the masked
ones of the Grand Opera, and other theatres, at which there was
dissipation and diablerie enough to satisfy the most ardent
imagination, ending with the <i>grande ronde infernale</i>.&nbsp;
I made many acquaintances, and if they were not by any means all
highly respectable, they were at least generally very singular or
notorious.&nbsp; One day I would dine at a place outside the
Barrier, where we had a plain but fairly good dinner for a franc,
<i>vin compris</i>, and where the honoured guest at the head of
the table was the <i>chef des claqueurs</i> or head of the paid
applauders at all the theatres.&nbsp; Then it would be at a
private <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> of <i>lorettes</i>, where
there was after dinner a little private card-playing.&nbsp; I
heard afterwards that two or three unprincipled gamblers found
their way into this nest of poor little innocents and swindled
them out of all their money.&nbsp; When I was well in funds I
would dine at Magny&rsquo;s, where, in those days, one could get
such a dinner for ten francs as fifty would not now
purchase.&nbsp; When <i>au sec</i>, I fed at
Flictoteau&rsquo;s&mdash;we called him
<i>l&rsquo;empoisonneur</i>&mdash;where hundreds of students got
a meal of three courses with half a bottle of ordinaire, and not
so bad either, for thirty sous.</p>
<p>It happened one night at Bobinot&rsquo;s that I sat in the
front row of the stage-box, and by me a very pretty, modest, and
respectable young girl, with her elder relations or
friends.&nbsp; How it happened I do not know, but they all went
out, leaving the young lady by me, and I did not speak to
her.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Which &ldquo;point&rdquo; was at once seized by the
house.&nbsp; The pit, as if moved by one diabolical inspiration,
began to roar, &ldquo;<i>Il l&rsquo;embrassera</i>!&rdquo; (He
will kiss her), to which the gallery replied, &ldquo;<i>Il ne
l&rsquo;embrassera pas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they kept it up and down alternately like see-sawing, to an
intonation; and be it remarked, by the way, that in French such a
monotonous bore is known as a <i>scie</i> or saw, as may be read
in my romance in the French tongue entitled <i>Le Lutin du
Ch&acirc;teau</i>, which was, I regret to say, refused by
Hachette the publisher on account of its freedom from
strait-laced, blue-nosed, Puritanical conventionalism, albeit he
praised its literary merit and style, as did sundry other French
scholars, if I may say it&mdash;who should not!</p>
<p>I saw that something must be done; so, rising, I waved my
glove, and there was dead silence.&nbsp; Then I began at the top
of my voice, in impassioned style in German, an address about
matters and things in general, intermingled with insane
quotations from Latin, Slavonian, anything.&nbsp; A change came
o&rsquo;er the spirit of the dream of my auditors, till at last
they &ldquo;took,&rdquo; and gave me three cheers.&nbsp; I had
<i>sold</i> the house!</p>
<p>There was in the Rue de la Harpe a house called the
H&ocirc;tel de Luxembourg.&nbsp; It was the fragment of a very
old palace which had borne that name.&nbsp; It had still a
magnificent Renaissance staircase, which bore witness to its
former glory.&nbsp; Washington Irving, in one of his earlier
tales, describes this very house and the rooms which I occupied
in it so accurately, that I think he must have dwelt there.&nbsp;
He tells that a student once, during the Revolution, finding a
young lady in the street, took her home with him to that
house.&nbsp; She had a black ribbon round her neck.&nbsp; He
twitched it away, when&mdash;off fell her head.&nbsp; She had
been guillotined, and revived by sorcery.</p>
<p>I soon removed to this house, where I had two very good-sized
rooms.&nbsp; In the same establishment dwelt a small actress or
two, and divers students, or men who were extremely busy <!--
page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>all the winter in plotting a revolution.&nbsp; It was
considered as a nest of rather doubtful and desperate characters,
and an American <i>carabin</i> or student of medicine told me of
another who had fled from the establishment after a few
days&rsquo; experience, &ldquo;for fear lest he should have his
throat cut.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was very silly, for none of us
would have cut anybody&rsquo;s throat for any
consideration.&nbsp; Some time ago I read the &ldquo;Memoirs of
Claude,&rdquo; who was the head of police in Paris during my
time, and I was quite startled to find how many of the
notorieties chronicled in his experiences had been known to me
personally.&nbsp; As, for instance, Madame Marie Farcey, who he
declares had a heart of gold, and with whom I had many a curious
conversation.&nbsp; She was a handsome, very ladylike, suave sort
of a person, who was never known to have an intrigue with any
man, but who was &ldquo;far and away&rdquo; at the very head of
all the immorality in Paris, as is well known to everybody who
was deeply about town in the Forties.&nbsp; Claude himself I
never knew, and it was to his possible great loss; for there came
a time when I could, had I chosen, have given him information
which would have kept him in office and Louis Philippe on the
throne, and turned the whole course of the events of 1848, as I
will now clearly and undeniably prove.</p>
<p>I did not live in the H&ocirc;tel de Luxembourg for nothing,
and I knew what was going on, and what was coming, and that there
was to be the devil to pay.&nbsp; Claude tells us in his
&ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; that the revolution of February 24 took him
so much by surprise that he had only three hours&rsquo; previous
notice of it, and really not time to remove his office
furniture.&nbsp; Now, <i>one month</i> before it burst out I
wrote home to my brother that we were to have a revolution on the
24th of February, and that it would certainly succeed.&nbsp;
Those who would learn all the true causes and reasons of this may
find them in my forthcoming translation of &ldquo;Heine&rsquo;s
Letters from Paris,&rdquo; with my notes.&nbsp; The police of
Paris were very clever, but the whole organisation was in so few
hands, and <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>we managed so well, that they never
found us out.&nbsp; It was beyond all question the neatest,
completest, and cheapest revolution ever executed.&nbsp;
Lamartine himself was not allowed to know anything about it till
he was wanted for President.&nbsp; And all over the Latin
Quarter, on our side of the river, in caf&eacute;s and balls and
in shops, and talking to everybody, went the mysterious dwellers
of the H&ocirc;tel de Luxembourg, sounding public opinion and
gathering signs and omens, and making recruits and laying trains,
which, when fired, caused explosions all over Europe, and sounds
which still live in history.&nbsp; And all the work was duly
reported at head-quarters.&nbsp; The great secret of the success
of the revolution was that it was in the hands of so few persons,
who were all absolutely secret and trustworthy.&nbsp; If there
had been a few more, the police would have found us out to a
certainty.&nbsp; One who was suspected was
&ldquo;squared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the ball opened.&nbsp; There was the great banquet,
and the muttering storm, and angry mobs, and small
<i>&eacute;meutes</i>.&nbsp; There is a mere alley&mdash;I forget
its name&mdash;on the right bank, which runs down to the Seine,
in which it is said that every Paris revolution has broken
out.&nbsp; Standing at its entrance, I saw three or four shots
fired and dark forms with guns moving in the alley, and then came
General Changarnier with his cavalry and made a charge, before
which I fled.&nbsp; I had to dodge more than one of these charges
during the day.&nbsp; Before dark the rioting was general, and
barricades were going up.&nbsp; The great storm-bell of
N&ocirc;tre Dame rung all night long.</p>
<p>The next morning I rose, and telling Leonard Field, who lived
in the same hotel with me, that I was going to work in earnest,
loaded a pair of duelling-pistols, tied a sash round my waist
<i>en r&eacute;volutionnaire</i>, and with him went forth to
business.&nbsp; First I went to the Caf&eacute; Rotonde, hard by,
and got my breakfast.&nbsp; Then I sallied forth, and found in
the Rue de la Harpe a gang of fifty insurgents, who had arms and
a crowbar, but who wanted a leader.&nbsp; Seeing that I was one
of <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>them, one said to me, &ldquo;Sir, where shall we make a
barricade?&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied that there was one already to
the right and another farther down, but that a third close at
hand was open.&nbsp; Without a word they handed me the crowbar,
and I prized up the stones out of the pavement, while they
undertook the harder work of piling them up.&nbsp; In a few
minutes we had a solid wall eight feet high.&nbsp; Field had on
light kid gloves, which formed an amusing contrast to his
occupation.&nbsp; Then remembering that there was a defenceless
spot somewhere else, I marched my troop thither, and built
another barricade&mdash;all in grim earnest without talking.</p>
<p>I forgot to say that on the previous day I had witnessed a
marvellously dramatic scene in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, by the
market-house.&nbsp; There was across it an immense barricade,
made of literally everything&mdash;old beds, waggons, stones, and
rubbish&mdash;and it was guarded by a dense crowd of insurgents,
armed or unarmed, of whom I was one.&nbsp; All around were at
least three thousand people singing the <i>Marseillaise</i> and
the <i>Chant des Girondins</i>.&nbsp; There was a charge of
infantry, a discharge of muskets, and fifteen fell dead, some
almost touching me, while the mob around never ceased their
singing, and the sounds of that tremendous and terrible chorus
mingled with the dying groans and cries of the victims and the
great roar of the bell of Notre Dame.&nbsp; It was like a scene
in the opera.&nbsp; This very barricade has been described by
Victor Hugo in detail, but not all which took place there, the
whole scene being, in fact, far more dramatic or picturesque than
he supposed it to have been.</p>
<p>It seemed to be predestined that I should see every great
event in that drama, from the charge of Changarnier down to the
very end, and I hereby declare that on my honour I set forth
exactly what I saw with my own eyes, without a shade of colour
off the truth.</p>
<p>There was a gar&ccedil;on named Edouard, who always waited on
me in the Caf&eacute; Rotonde.&nbsp; While I was working for life
at my second barricade, he came out holding a napkin, and <!--
page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>examining my labour critically, waved it, exclaimed
approvingly, &ldquo;<i>Tr&egrave;s bien</i>, <i>Citoyen
Charles</i>&mdash;<i>tr&egrave;s bien</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
his little joke for some days after to call me Citoyen
Charles.</p>
<p>Returning down the Rue de la Harpe before our house my
landlady exclaimed to me in alarm, &ldquo;Hide your pistols!
there is a <i>mouchard</i> (spy of the police) following
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that I, my blood being up, said
something to the effect that if she would point him out I would
shoot him forthwith, but the <i>mouchard</i> had vanished.&nbsp;
We had all got into cool earnestness by that time as regards
shooting, having been in it constantly for three days.</p>
<p>Over the barricade came sprawling a tall ungainly red-haired
Yankee, a student of medicine, whom I had met before, and who
began to question me as to what I was doing.&nbsp; To which I
replied, &ldquo;What the devil do you want here, anyhow?&rdquo;
not being in a mood to be trifled with.&nbsp; To which he
replied, &ldquo;Nawthin&rsquo;, only a kinder lookin&rsquo;
reound.&nbsp; But what on airth&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But
are you for us, or against?&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;W&auml;ll, I ain&rsquo;t on no side.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; I cried in a rage; &ldquo;those who are
not for us are against us.&nbsp; Any one of those fellows you see
round here would shoot you at once if I told him to, and if you
don&rsquo;t clear out in double quick time, by God I
will!&rdquo;&nbsp; And at this he made himself scarce forthwith,
&ldquo;nor does he come again into this story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I went down the street, and as a large supply of
ammunition came to us from our friends, with the aid of a student
of the Ecole Polytechnique, I distributed it to the mob.&nbsp; I
had principally boxes of percussion-caps to give.&nbsp; I mention
this because that young man has gone into history for it, and I
have as good a right to a share in this extremely small exploit
as he.&nbsp; Besides, though not wounded by the foe, I got a bad
cut on my hand from a sharp paving-stone, and its scar lasted for
many years.</p>
<p>I had that day many a chance to knock over a <i>piou-piou</i>
or shoot a soldier, as Field said, but I must confess that I felt
an invincible repugnance to do so.&nbsp; The poor devils <!--
page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>were, after all, only fighting unwillingly against us,
and I well knew that unless they came over to our side all would
be up with us.&nbsp; Therefore it was our policy to spare them as
much as possible.&nbsp; I owe it to Field to state that through
all the stirring scenes of the Revolution he displayed great
calmness and courage.</p>
<p>All at once we heard a terrible outcry down the street.&nbsp;
There was a tremendous massing of soldiers there, and to defend
that barricade meant death to all defenders.&nbsp; I confess that
I hesitated <i>one instant</i>, and than rushed headlong to join
the fight.&nbsp; Merciful God! the troops had fraternised with
us, and they were handing over their muskets to the mob, who were
firing them in the air.</p>
<p>The scene was terribly moving.&nbsp; My men, who a minute
before had expected to be shot, rushed up, embraced and kissed
the soldiers, wept like children&mdash;in short, everybody kissed
and embraced everybody else, and all my warriors got guns, and
therewith I dismissed them, for I knew that the war was now about
at an end.</p>
<p>There was a German-French student named Lenoir, and he, with
Field and I, hearing that there was sharp work at the Tuileries,
started thither in haste.&nbsp; And truly enough, when we got
there, the very devil was loose, with guns firing and the
guard-house all in a blaze.&nbsp; The door was burst open, and
Field and I were among the very first who entered.&nbsp; We
behaved very well, and did not steal anything.&nbsp; I remember
that there was a great pile of plate and jewellery soon laid by
the door.</p>
<p>I went into the throne-room.&nbsp; There was a great silver
inkstand on the table, paper and pens, and we wrote,
&ldquo;Respect Property!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Liberty for Italy
and Hungary!&rdquo; and hung the papers up around the room.&nbsp;
I wrote one or two myself, and <i>touched</i> the inkstand for
luck, in case I should ever write about the event.</p>
<p>It was a great and indeed a very touching and beautiful sight,
for all present were inspired with a feeling like that <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>of
men who have passed a terrible, racking crisis.&nbsp; <i>Nous
avons vaincu</i>!&nbsp; Yes, we had conquered.&nbsp; And the
Revolution had marched sternly on through years of discontent
unto the year of aggravation, Forty-Eight, when there was thunder
all round in Europe&mdash;and after all, France at one desperate
bound had again placed herself in the van!&nbsp; And it was first
decided by the taking of the Tuileries!</p>
<p>Let me dwell an instant on some minor incidents.&nbsp; Many of
the insurgents had been all night without food.&nbsp; The royal
dinner was cooking in the kitchen, and it was droll to see the
men helping themselves and walking off with the chickens and
joints on their bayonets.&nbsp; I had never seen a royal kitchen
before.&nbsp; Soon all along the street loafers were seen with
jars of preserved cherries, &amp;c., emptying them into their
caps.&nbsp; I went into the burning guard-house.&nbsp; A savage
fellow offered me a great tin pail, containing about two gallons
of wine, which he offered me to drink.&nbsp; I was very thirsty,
but I had a scruple against plunder.&nbsp; Grasping his sword, he
cried, &ldquo;<i>Buvez</i>, <i>citoyen</i>; <i>c&rsquo;est du vin
royal</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to have a duel <i>&agrave;
l&rsquo;outrance</i> with a fellow-patriot, and, as I said, being
thirsty, I took a good long pull.&nbsp; We mutually winked and
smiled.&nbsp; He took a pull also to my health and Liberty.&nbsp;
We both &ldquo;pulled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forgot to mention how my cohort had partially armed
themselves that morning.&nbsp; They burst into every house and
carried off all the arms they could find, and then wrote in chalk
over the doors&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Armes
donn&eacute;es</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mus&eacute;e Cluny was very
near my hotel and I saw it plundered.&nbsp; Such a sight!&nbsp; I
saw one vagabond on a fine stolen horse, with a medi&aelig;val
helmet on his head, a lance in his hand, and a six-feet
double-handed sword or flamberg hanging behind his back.&nbsp; He
appeared to be quite drunk, and reared about in eccentric
<i>gambades</i>.&nbsp; This genius of Freedom reappeared at the
Tuileries.&nbsp; Mortal man was never under such temptation to
steal as I was&mdash;just one fifteenth-century poignard as a
souvenir&mdash;from that Museum&mdash;in fact, it was my
<i>duty</i> at <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>that instant to do so, whispered the
tempter in my ear.&nbsp; But I resisted; and lo! it came to pass
in later years that I became possessed, for a mere trifle, in
Dresden, of the court dagger, in exquisite carved ivory, which
was originally made for Francis II. of France, and which has been
declared by competent authority to be authentic.&nbsp; Owing to
his short reign there are very few relics of this monarch.</p>
<p>Some of the blackguards in the mob drew out the royal
carriages, set fire to them, and rolled them gaily along the
<i>quai</i>.</p>
<p>A noble-looking very old gentleman in military costume spoke
to me before the Tuileries, and saying that he had seen all of
the old Revolution and Napoleon&rsquo;s wars, actually with tears
in his eyes implored me to use my influence to prevent any
plundering.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Respectez la
propert&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were very few gentlemen
indeed among the insurgents.&nbsp; I only observed two or three
in our quarter, and they were all from our hotel, or rather
lodgings.&nbsp; But the next day every swell in Paris came out as
an insurgent.&nbsp; <i>They</i> had all worked at
barricades&mdash;so they said.&nbsp; I certainly had not seen any
of them at work.</p>
<p>That afternoon I strolled about with Field.&nbsp; We came to a
barricade.&nbsp; A very pretty girl guarded it with a
sword.&nbsp; She sternly demanded the parole or
countersign.&nbsp; I caught hold of her and kissed her, and
showed my pistols.&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; As I was armed with
dirk and pistols, wore a sash, and was unmistakably a Latin
Quarter <i>&eacute;tudiant</i>, as shown by long hair, rakish cap
on one side, red neck-tie, and single eyeglass, I was everywhere
treated as a man and brother, friend and equal, warrior,
and&mdash;by the girls&mdash;almost like a first-cousin.&nbsp;
Field shared the glory, of course.&nbsp; And we made a great deal
out of it, and were thought all the more of in consequence.&nbsp;
<i>Vive la jeunesse</i>!</p>
<p>Coming to a corner, we heard three or four musket-shots.&nbsp;
We turned the corner, and saw a man lying dead or dying in the
last quiver, while at his head there was at once placed a <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>stick with a paper on it, on which was written with
lead-pencil, &ldquo;<i>Mort aux voleurs</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day before, one insurgent had offered me a beautiful old
silver-mounted sword for one of my pistols, fire-arms being so
much in demand, but I declined the offer.</p>
<p>The day after, I went into a caf&eacute;.&nbsp; There were
some students there who had laid their arms on a table.&nbsp;
There was a very notorious little <i>lorette</i>, known as
Pochardinette, who was so called because she was always
half-tipsy.&nbsp; She was even noted in a popular song
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La Pochardinette,<br />
Qui ne sait refuser<br />
Ni la ponche a pleine verre,<br />
Ni sa bouohe &agrave; baiser.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pochardinette picked up a horse-pistol, when its owner cried,
&ldquo;Let that be!&nbsp; That is not the kind of weapon which
<i>you</i> are accustomed to manage!&rdquo;&nbsp; I stared at him
with respect, for he had actually translated into French an
epigram by Jacopo Sannazar, word for word!</p>
<p>I should here mention that on the 24th there was actually a
period of two hours during which France had no
Government&mdash;that is, none that it knew of.&nbsp; Then there
appeared on the walls all at once small placards giving the list
of names of the <i>Gouvernement Provisoire</i>.&nbsp; Now, during
this period of suspense there appeared at the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville a mysterious stranger; a small, bustling, active
individual, who came in and announced that a new Government had
been formed, that he himself had been appointed Minister, that
France expected every man to do his duty, and that no one should
lose their places who conformed to his orders.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
appoint,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;So-and-so to take command of
Vincennes.&nbsp; Here, you&mdash;<i>Chose</i>! notify him at once
and send orders.&nbsp; I believe that <i>Tel-et-tel</i> had
better take Marseilles.&nbsp; Do any of you fellows know of a
good governor for Mauritius?&rdquo;&nbsp; So <i>he</i> governed
France for half-an-hour and then disappeared, and nobody ever
knew to this day who this stupendous joker was.&nbsp; <!-- page
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>A
full account of it all appeared some time after, and the cream of
the joke was that some of his appointed ones contrived to keep
their places.&nbsp; This brief dynasty has not been recorded in
any work save this!</p>
<p>It was a droll fact that I had, the year before, at
Heidelberg, drawn a picture of myself as an insurgent at a
barricade, and written under it, &ldquo;The Boy of the
Barricades.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had long had a strange presentiment as
to this event.&nbsp; I gave the picture to Peter A. Porter, then
a student, and owner of a singular piece of property&mdash;that
is, Niagara Falls, or at least Goat Island and more or less of
the American side.&nbsp; Some time after the 24th he showed me
this picture in Paris.&nbsp; He himself, I have heard, died
fighting bravely in our Civil War.&nbsp; His men were so much
attached to him that they made, to recover his body, a special
sally, in which twelve of them were killed.&nbsp; He was <i>bon
compagnon</i>, very pleasant, and gifted with a very original,
quaint humour.</p>
<p>If our ungrateful temporary stepmother, France, did not know
it, at least the waiters in the caf&eacute;s, shopkeepers, and
other people in the Latin Quarter were aware that Field and I
were among the extremely small and select number of gentlemen who
had operated at the barricades for the health of Freedom, and for
some time we never entered a restaurant without hearing admiring
exclamations from the respectful waiters of &ldquo;<i>Ces sont
les Am&eacute;ricains</i>!&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Les
Anglais</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And indeed, to a small degree, I even
made a legendary local impression; for a friend of mine who went
from Philadelphia to Paris two years later, reported that I was
still in the memory of the Quarter as associated with the
Revolution and life in general.&nbsp; One incident was indeed of
a character which French students would not forget.&nbsp; I had
among my many friends, reputable and demi-reputable, a rather
remarkable <i>lorette</i> named Maria, whose face was the very
replica of that of the Laughing Faun of the Louvre&mdash;or, if
one can conceive it, of a very pretty &ldquo;white
nigger.&rdquo;&nbsp; This young lady being either
<i>ennuy&eacute;e</i> or frightened by the roar of
musketry&mdash;<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>probably the former&mdash;and
knowing that I was a Revolutionist and at work, conceived the
eccentric idea of hiring a coach, just when the fighting was at
the worst, and driving over from the Rue Helder to visit
me.&nbsp; Which she actually did.&nbsp; When she came to a
barricade, she gave five francs to the champions of liberty, and
told them she was bearing important political orders to one of
their leaders.&nbsp; Then the warriors would unharness the
horses, lift the carriage and beasts somehow over the barricade,
re-harness, hurrah, and &ldquo;<i>Adieu</i>, <i>madame</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Vive la libert&eacute;</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, amid bullets
and cheers, and death-stroke, and powder-smoke&mdash;<i>hinc et
inde mors et luctus</i>&mdash;Maria came to my door in a
carriage, and found me out with a vengeance&mdash;for I was
revelling at the time in the royal halls of the Bourbons, or at
least drinking wine out of a tin pail in the guard-house, whereby
I escaped the expense of a truffled champagne dinner at
Magny&rsquo;s&mdash;while the young lady was about fifty francs
out of pocket by her little drive, probably the only one taken
that day in Paris.&nbsp; But she had a fearfully jolly time of
it, and saw the way that guns were fired to perfection.&nbsp;
This, too, became one of the published wonders of the day, and a
local legend of renown.</p>
<p>Of course all these proceedings put an end to lectures and
study for the time.&nbsp; Then Mr. Goodrich, our Consul, as I
have before said, organised a deputation of Americans in Paris to
go and congratulate the new <i>Gouvernement Provisoire</i> on the
new Republic, of which I was one, and we saw all the great men,
and Arago made us a speech.&nbsp; Unfortunately all the bankers
stopped paying money, and I had to live principally on credit, or
sailed rather close to it, until I could write to my father and
get a draft on London.</p>
<p>But when the Revolution of June was coming, I determined to
leave Paris.&nbsp; I had no sympathy for the Socialists, and I
knew very well that neither the new Government, nor the still
newer Louis Napoleon, who was looming up so dangerously behind
it, needed <i>my</i> small aid.&nbsp; There was a regulation <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>in those days that every foreign resident on leaving
Paris must give twenty-four hours&rsquo; notice to the police
before he could obtain his passport.&nbsp; But when I applied for
mine, it was handed out at once &ldquo;over the counter,&rdquo;
with a smile and a wink, as if unto one who was merrily well
known, with an intimation that they were rather glad that I was
going, and would do everything to facilitate my departure.&nbsp;
I suspect that my <i>dossier</i> must have been interesting
reading!&nbsp; M. Claude, or his successor, was probably of the
same mind regarding me as the old black preacher in Philadelphia
regarding a certain convert, &ldquo;De Lawd knows we don&rsquo;
want no sitch bredderin in <i>dis</i> congregation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went to Rouen and saw the cathedral and churches&mdash;it
was a very quaint old town then&mdash;and thence to Havre, where
I took passage on a steamboat for London.&nbsp; The captain had a
very curious old Gnostic-Egyptian ring, with a gem on which were
four animal heads in one, or a chim&aelig;ra.&nbsp; I explained
what it was, and that it meant the year.&nbsp; But the captain
could not rest till he had got the opinion of a fussy old
Frenchman, who, as a doctor, was of course supposed to know more
than I.&nbsp; He looked at it, and, with a great air, remarked,
&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est grecque</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the captain
was <i>quite</i> satisfied.&nbsp; It was Greek!</p>
<p>I went in London to a very modest hotel, where I was, however,
very comfortable.&nbsp; In those days a bottle of the very vilest
claret conceivable, and far worse than &ldquo;Gladstone,&rdquo;
cost four or five shillings; therefore I took to pale ale.&nbsp;
Ewan Colquhoun soon found me out, and, under his guidance, and
that of two or three others whom I had met, I soon explored
London.&nbsp; Firstly, he took me daily to his house in St. James
Street, where I can recall his mother, Mrs. Colquhoun, and
father, and brothers, Patrick and James.&nbsp; Patrick was a
remarkable young man.&nbsp; He had graduated at Cambridge and
Heidelberg and filled diplomatic capacities in the East, and was
familiar with many languages from Arabic to Gaelic, and was the
first amateur <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>light-weight boxer in England, and
first sculler on the Thames, and had translated and annotated the
principal compendium of Roman law.&nbsp; He took me to see a
grand rowing match, where we were in the <i>Leander</i>
barge.&nbsp; So here and there I was introduced to a great many
people of the best society.&nbsp; Meanwhile, with Ewan, I visited
the Cider Cellars, Evans&rsquo;, the Judge and Jury Club,
Cremorne, and all the gay resorts of those days, not to mention
the museums, Tower, and everything down to Madame
Tussaud&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I went down in a diving-bell in the
Polytechnic, and over Barclay and Perkins&rsquo; Brewery.</p>
<p>One night Colquhoun and I went to Drury Lane, and, after
hearing Grisi, Mario, and Lablache together, saw the great <i>pas
de quatre</i> which became a historical marvel.&nbsp; For it was
danced by Taglioni, Cerito, Carlotta Grisi, and Lucile
Grahn.&nbsp; In after years, when I talked with Taglioni about
it, she assured me that night I had witnessed what the world had
never seen since, the greatest and most perfect execution
conceivable.&nbsp; For the four great artists, moved by rivalry,
were inspired to do their best before such an audience as was
seldom seen.&nbsp; Colquhoun kept pointing out one celebrity
after another to me; I verily believe that I saw most of the
great men and women of the time.&nbsp; And afterwards I saw a
great number in Parliament.</p>
<p>There was a rather distinguished-looking Frenchman very much
about town in London while I was there.&nbsp; He was always
alone, and always dressed in a long, light overcoat.&nbsp;
Wherever I went, to Cremorne or the Park, there he was.&nbsp;
When Louis Napoleon came up in the world and I saw his
photograph, I at once recognised my Frenchman.</p>
<p>There roomed next to me in our hotel a German from Vienna
named Becker.&nbsp; He was an opera-singer, and the newspapers
said that he was fully equal to the first baritone of the
day.&nbsp; I forget who that was: was it Pischek?&nbsp; I liked
him very much; he was always in my room, and always singing
little bits, but I was not much impressed by them, and <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>once told him that I believed that I could sing as
loudly as he.&nbsp; He never said a word, but at once let out his
whole voice in a tremendous <i>aria</i>.&nbsp; I clapped my hands
to my ears; I verily believed that he would shatter the
windows!&nbsp; I have heard of a singer who actually broke a
goblet by vibration, and I now believe that it is possible.&nbsp;
I was once shown in the Hague Museum a goblet which rang
marvellously in accompaniment when one sang to it, and have met
with others like it.</p>
<p>I was invited by a young friend named Hunt (a son of the great
Chartist), who had been a friend of mine in Heidelberg, where he
had taken his degree as doctor of Philosophy, to pass a week in
the country at a charming old Elizabethan place, said to have
been the original Bleak House.&nbsp; Everything there was
perfectly delightful.&nbsp; There were two or three charming
young ladies.&nbsp; I remember among them a Miss Oliphaunt.&nbsp;
There was a glorious picnic, to which I and all walked eight
miles and back.&nbsp; I admired on this occasion for the first
time the pedestrian powers of English girls.</p>
<p>I visited Verulamium and St. Alban&rsquo;s Abbey, not then
&ldquo;restored,&rdquo; and other beautiful places.&nbsp; It all
seemed like a fairy-tale, for the charm of my early reading came
over me like enchantment.&nbsp; One night Hunt and I went into a
little wayside inn.&nbsp; There were assembled a number of
peasants&mdash;hedgers and ditchers, or such like.&nbsp; We
treated them to ale, and they sang many strange old songs.&nbsp;
Then I was called on, and I sang &ldquo;Sir Patrick Spens,&rdquo;
which was well received.</p>
<p>I returned to London, and found, to my dismay, that I had not
enough money to take me home!&nbsp; I had received a bill of
exchange on a merchant in London, and, in my innocence, never
dreamed that it constituted no claim on him whatever for a
further supply.&nbsp; I called at his office, saw his son, who
naturally informed me that they could advance me no more money,
but referred me to his father.&nbsp; The old gentleman seemed to
be amused, and questioned me all about <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>myself.&nbsp; When he found that his Philadelphia
correspondent was very well known to my father, and that the son
of the correspondent was a fellow-student of mine at Heidelberg
and Paris, he asked me how much I wanted.&nbsp; When I replied,
&ldquo;Only enough to pay my passage,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; and at once gave me the money.&nbsp;
Then he questioned me as to my friends in London, and said,
&ldquo;You have seen something of the aristocracy, I would like
you to see some of the business people.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he
invited me to a dinner at the Reform Club, to meet a few
friends.&nbsp; Among these was a Mr. Birch, son of the celebrated
Alderman Birch.&nbsp; He had directed the dinner, being a famous
<i>gourmet</i>, and Soyer had cooked it.&nbsp; That dinner cost
my host far more than he had made out of me.&nbsp; We had six
kinds of choicest wines, which impressed me <i>then</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Birch was a man of literary culture, and we went deeply
into books.&nbsp; The next day he sent me a charming work which
he had written on the religious belief of Shakespeare, in which
it was fairly proved that the immortal bard had none.&nbsp; And I
was so well pleased with England, that I liked it better than any
country I had ever visited.</p>
<p>In 1870, when I came to London, and found my character of
&ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rdquo; on three stages at once, I received,
of course, a great deal of attention.&nbsp; Somebody said to me,
&ldquo;Oh, of course; you come here well known, and are made a
great deal of.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;Twenty years ago I
came to London without a single letter of introduction, and had
only two or three student friends, and received just as much kind
hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think that like generally finds its
like, so long as it is honest and can pay its bills.</p>
<p>I left Portsmouth for New York in a sailing-vessel or
packet.&nbsp; I could have returned by steamer, but preferred the
latter, as I should now, if there were any packets crossing the
ocean.&nbsp; In old times travel was a pleasure or an art; now it
is the science of getting from place to place in the shortest
time possible.&nbsp; Hence, with all our patent Pullman cars and
<!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>their dentist&rsquo;s chairs, Procrustean sofas, and
headlong passages, we do <i>not</i> enjoy ourselves as we did
when the coach went on the road so slowly as to allow us to see
the country, when we halted often and long, many a time in
curious old villages.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the idea of dragging along
in that way!&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, and what, O tourist, dost thou
travel <i>for</i>?</p>
<p>There was on the vessel in which I sailed, among the few
passengers, Mrs. and Mr. John Gilbert, a well-known dramatic
couple, who were extremely agreeable and genial, the husband
abounding in droll reminiscences of the stage; a merry little
German musician named Kreutzer, son of the great composer; and a
young Englishwoman with a younger brother.&nbsp; I rather doubted
the &ldquo;solidity&rdquo; of this young lady.&nbsp; By-and-bye
it was developed that the captain was in love with her.&nbsp; Out
of this, I have heard, came a dreadful tragedy; for the love
drove him mad, the insanity developing itself on the return
voyage.&nbsp; The captain had to be imprisoned in his own
state-room, where he committed suicide in a terrible manner by
tearing his throat open with the point of a candlestick or
sconce.&nbsp; The second mate, who was as coarse a brute as a
common sailor could be, took command, and as he at once got
drunk, and kept so, the passengers rose, confined him, and gave
the command to the third, who was very young.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus woman is the cause of fearful
deeds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I freely admit that this incident resulted from a
long voyage, for we were thirty-five days in going from port to
port.&nbsp; In only a week, with three or four days&rsquo;
preliminary sea-sickness, there is hardly time for
&ldquo;flirtation and its consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was it
so much a stormy trip as one with long sunny calms.&nbsp; Then we
hauled up Gulf-weed with little crabs&mdash;saw Portuguese
men-of-war or sea-anemones sailing along like Cleopatra&rsquo;s
barges with purple sails, or counted flying-fish.&nbsp; Apropos
of this last I have something to say.&nbsp; During my last trip I
once devoted an afternoon to closely observing these bird-like
creatures, and very distinctly <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>saw two
cases in which the fish turned and flew against the wind or
tacked&mdash;a fact which has been denied.</p>
<p>One day I saw a few rudder-fish playing about the stern.&nbsp;
They weigh perhaps some six or seven pounds; so, standing on
velvet cushions in the cabin, I fished out of the
stern-window.&nbsp; Then came a bite, and in a second I had my
fish flapping about on the carpet under the table, to the great
amazement of the steward, who had probably never had a live fish
jump so promptly before into his hands.&nbsp; And we had it for
dinner.&nbsp; One day a ship made to us a signal of distress, and
sent a boat, saying that they were completely out of fuel; also
that their passengers consisted entirely of the celebrated Ravel
troupe of acrobats and actors.&nbsp; It would have been an
experience to have crossed in that packet with their chief,
Gabriel!</p>
<p>Gabriel Ravel&mdash;it is one of my brother&rsquo;s published
tales&mdash;was a good boxer as well as a marvellous acrobat, and
he could <i>look</i> like what he pleased.&nbsp; One morning a
muscular and vain New York swell saw in a gymnasium one whom he
supposed to be a very verdant New Jersey rustic gaping
about.&nbsp; The swell exhibited with great pride his skill on
the parallel bars, horizontal pole, <i>et cetera</i>, and seeing
the countryman absolutely dumbfounded with astonishment, proposed
to the latter to put on the gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jersey&rdquo;
hardly seemed to know what gloves were, but with much trouble he
was got into form and set to milling.&nbsp; But though he was as
awkward as a blind cow, the swell pugilist could not for a very
long time get in a blow.&nbsp; Jersey dodged every hit
&ldquo;somehow&rdquo; in a manner which seemed to be
miraculous.&nbsp; At last one told on his chest, and it appeared
to be a stunner, for it knocked him into the air, where he turned
a double somersault, and then fell on his feet.&nbsp; And it
seemed as if, during this flight, he had been suddenly inspired
with a knowledge of the manly art, for on descending, he went at
the swell and knocked him from time.&nbsp; It was Gabriel
Ravel.</p>
<p>We saw an iceberg far away, and lay off on the Grand <!-- page

and beheld a water-spout&mdash;I once saw two at a time in the
Mediterranean&mdash;and whales, which were far commoner then than
now, it being rumoured that the one, and no more, which is
regularly seen by passengers now is a tame one belonging to the
White Star or some other line, which keeps him moored in a
certain place on exhibition; also that what Gulf-weed there is
left is grown near New York and scattered by night from certain
boats.&nbsp; It may be so&mdash;this is an artificial age.&nbsp;
All that remains is to learn that the flying-fish are No. 3 salt
mackerel set with springs, and I am not sure that I should doubt
even <i>that</i>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So we arrived in New York, and within an hour or two after my
arrival I was in the train <i>en route</i> for
Philadelphia.&nbsp; On the way, I intrusted a newsboy with an
English shilling to go and get me change.&nbsp; I still await
that change.&nbsp; And in Philadelphia the hackman who drove me
to my father&rsquo;s house, as soon as the trunks were removed,
departed suddenly, carrying away with him a small hand-bag
containing several valuable objects, which I never
recovered.&nbsp; I began to think that if the object of travel be
to learn to keep one&rsquo;s <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>eyes open
and avoid being swindled, that I had better have remained at
home.</p>
<p>My father had removed to another house in Walnut Street, below
Twelfth Street.&nbsp; After this he only changed dwellings once
more before his death.&nbsp; This constant change from one rented
house to another, like the changes from school to school, is very
unfortunate, as I have before said, for any family.&nbsp; It
destroys all the feeling and unity of character which grow up in
a settled <i>home</i>.</p>
<p>I pass over the joy of again seeing my parents, the dear
sisters, and brother Henry.&nbsp; I was soon settled down, soon
visiting friends, going to evening parties, making morning or
afternoon calls, and after a little while was entered as a
law-student in the office of John Cadwallader in Fourth
Street.</p>
<p>I cannot pass over the fact, for it greatly influenced my
after life, that though everybody was very kind to me, and I was
even in a small way a kind of lion, the change from my late life
was very hard to bear.&nbsp; I have read a wonderful story of a
boy who while at a severe school had a marvellous dream.&nbsp; It
seemed to last for years, and while it lasted, he went to the
University, graduated, passed into diplomatic life, was a great
man and beloved; when all at once he awoke and found himself at
school again and birchable.&nbsp; After the freedom of student
life in Heidelberg and Munich and Paris, and having been among
the few who had carried out a great revolution, and much
familiarity with the most cosmopolite type of characters in
Europe, and existing in literature and art, I was settled down to
live, move, and have all being henceforth and perhaps for ever in
Philadelphia!&nbsp; Of which city, at that time, there was not
one in the world of which so little evil could be said, or so
much good, yet of which so few ever spoke with enthusiasm.&nbsp;
Its inhabitants were all well-bathed, well-clad, well-behaved;
all with exactly the same ideas and the same ideals.&nbsp; A
decided degree of refinement was everywhere perceptible, and they
were so fond of <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>flowers that I once ascertained by
careful inquiry that in most respectable families there was
annually much more money expended for bouquets than for
books.&nbsp; When a Philadelphian gave a dinner or supper, his
great care was to see that everything <i>on the table</i> was as
good or perfect as possible.&nbsp; I had been accustomed to first
considering what should be placed <i>around</i> it on the chairs
as the main item.&nbsp; The lines of demarcation in
&ldquo;society&rdquo; were as strongly drawn as in Europe, or
more so, with the enormous difference, however, that there was
not the slightest perceptible shade of difference in the
intellects, culture, or character of the people on either side of
the line, any more than there is among the school-boys on either
side of the mark drawn for a game.&nbsp; Very trifling points of
difference, not perceptible to an outsider, made the whole
difference between the exclusives and the excluded; just as the
witch-mark no larger than a needle-point indicates to the judge
the difference between the saved and the damned.</p>
<p>I had not been long engaged in studying law when I made the
acquaintance of Richard B. Kimball, a lawyer of New York, who had
written a few novels which were very popular, and are still
reprinted by Tauchnitz.&nbsp; He knew everybody, and took a great
interest in me, and opened the door for me to the
<i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i>.&nbsp; To this I had contributed
articles while at Princeton.&nbsp; I now sent it my translation
of Professor Neumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chinese in Mexico in the
Fifth Century.&rdquo;&nbsp; I forget whether this was in 1849 or
1850.&nbsp; In after years I expanded it to a book, of which a
certain Professor said, firstly in a paper read before the
American Asiatic Society, and secondly in a pamphlet, that there
was nothing of any importance in it which had not already
appeared in Bancroft&rsquo;s work on the Pacific.&nbsp; I wrote
to him, pointing out the fact that Bancroft&rsquo;s work did not
appear till many years after my article in the
<i>Knickerbocker</i>.&nbsp; To which the Sinologist replied very
suavely and apologetically indeed that he was &ldquo;very
sorry,&rdquo; but had never seen the article in <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>the <i>Knickerbocker</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; But he did not
<i>publish</i> the correction, as he should have done.&nbsp; For
which reason I now vindicate myself from the insinuated
accusation that I borrowed from Bancroft.&nbsp; I had, indeed,
almost forgotten this work, &ldquo;Fusang,&rdquo; when, in 1890,
Prince Roland Bonaparte, at a dinner given by him to the
Congr&egrave;s des Traditions Populaires, startled me by
recurring to it and speaking of it with great praise.&nbsp; For
it vindicates the claim of the French that Desguignes first
discovered the fact that the Chinese were the first to discover
America.&nbsp; If any one doubts this, let him read the truly
great work of Vinton on the whole.&nbsp; Prince Roland had been
in China and earnestly studied the subject.&nbsp; Von Eichthal
had endorsed my views, and wrote to me on Fusang.&nbsp; I have
been for many years well acquainted with his nephew, Baron von
Eichthal, and his remarkably accomplished wife, who is expert in
all the minor arts.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s resources became about this time limited,
and I, in fact, realised that he had taxed himself more than I
had supposed to maintain me abroad.&nbsp; His Congress Hall
property did not pay much rent.&nbsp; For my position in the
world, friends, studies, and society, I found myself very much
and very often in great need of money.&nbsp; As at that time we
were supposed to be much richer than we really were, this was an
additional source of trial.&nbsp; I began to see clearly that in
the law, as in all business or professions, I should have to wait
for years ere I could make a living.&nbsp; For the instances are
very few and far between in which a young man, who has not
inherited or grown up to a practice, can make one himself at
once.</p>
<p>More than this, I was not fitted for law at all.&nbsp; From my
birth I had absolutely one of those peculiar temperaments which
really disqualify men for &ldquo;business.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I had
entered a law-office in which there was much office-work or
practice, I might have acquired a practical interest in the
profession, but of this there was in ours literally none
whatever.&nbsp; I had a great fondness for copying deeds,
&amp;c., but Mr. <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Cadwallader, though he very much
admired my quaint round hand, being the very soul of honour,
observing that I was eager for such work, would not give me much
of it though it would have been to his profit, because, as he
said, &ldquo;students who paid should not be employed as clerks
only, much less as copying machines.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it had
always been deeply impressed on my mind by every American friend
that I had &ldquo;no business capacity,&rdquo; and, moreover, as
I greatly dreaded speaking in court, I had from the beginning a
great fear that I could never live by the law.&nbsp; I mention
this because there are many thousands of young men who suffer
terribly from such apprehension, and often ruin life by it.&nbsp;
A few months&rsquo; practice in a mercantile college will go far
to relieve the first apprehension, while as regards <i>stage
fright</i>, it can be easily educated out of anybody, as I have
since those days educated it out of myself, so that rising to
debate or speak inspires in me a <i>gaudium certaminis</i>, which
increases with the certainty of being attacked.&nbsp; Let the
aspirant begin by reading papers before, let us say, a family or
school, and continue to do so frequently and at as short
intervals as possible before such societies or lyceums as will
listen to him.&nbsp; Then let him speak from memory or improvise
and debate.&nbsp; This should form a part of all education
whatever, and it should be <i>thorough</i>.&nbsp; It is specially
needed for lawyers and divines, yet a great proportion of both
are most insufficiently trained in it; and while I was studying
law it was never mentioned to me.&nbsp; I was never so much as
once taken into court or <i>practically</i> employed in any
manner whatever.</p>
<p>I remember an amusing incident in the office.&nbsp; Mr.
Cadwallader asked me one day to call, returning from my lunch, on
a certain Mr. Dimpfel, one of his clients, leave a certain
message and his request as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I want you, Mr.
Leland, to be <i>very careful</i>.&nbsp; I have observed that you
are sometimes inaccurate in such matters, therefore be sure that
you give me Mr. Dimpfel&rsquo;s <i>very words</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Cadwallader knew French and Spanish perfectly, but not
German, and was <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>not aware that I always conversed
with Mr. Dimpfel in the latter language.&nbsp; When I returned my
teacher said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Leland, can you repeat accurately <i>word for
word</i> what Mr. Dimpfel said?&rdquo; I replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; <i>Der Herr Dimpfel l&auml;sst sich
gr&uuml;ssen und meldet das er Montag kommen wird um halb
drei</i>.&nbsp; <i>Und er sagt weiter</i> . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; cried Mr. Cadwallader; &ldquo;you
must give it in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; was my grave reply,
&ldquo;but you asked for his very words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to write for publication in 1849.&nbsp; Mr. John
Sartain, a great engraver, established a magazine, to which I
contributed several articles on art subjects, subsequently many
more on all subjects, and finally every month a certain number of
pages of humorous matter.&nbsp; A man named Manuel Cooke
established in Philadelphia a <i>Drawing-Room Journal</i>.&nbsp;
For this I wrote a great deal for a year or two.&nbsp; It paid me
no money, but gave me free admission to theatres, operas, etc.,
and I learned a great deal as to the practical management of a
newspaper.</p>
<p>The first summer after my return we went to Stonington, and
thence to visit our friends in New England, as of yore.&nbsp; At
Dedham I had an attack of cholera; my uncle, Dr. Stimson, gave me
during the night two doses of laudanum of fifty drops each, which
cured me.&nbsp; Father Matthew came to Dedham.&nbsp; I went with
a very pretty young cousin of mine named Marie Lizzie Fisher,
since deceased, to hear him preach.&nbsp; After the address,
meeting the Father, I went boldly up and introduced myself to
him, and then Miss Fisher.&nbsp; I think that his address must
have deeply affected me, since I was obliged to stop on my way
home to take a drink to steady my nerves.&nbsp; It was against
the law at that time to sell such &ldquo;poison,&rdquo; so the
hotel-keeper took me and my paternal uncle, George, who treated,
down into the cellar, where he had concealed some Hollands.&nbsp;
I can remember that that pleasant <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>summer in
Dedham I, one Sunday morning in the church during service,
composed a poem, which in after years even found its way into
&ldquo;The Poets and Poetry of America.&rdquo;&nbsp; It began
with the words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er an old ruined doorway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Philosophus hung,<br />
And madly his bell-cap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bauble he swung.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a wild mixture of cosmopolitanism and Hamletism, and it
indicates accurately the true state of my <i>cor cordium</i> at
that time.&nbsp; Earnest thought, or a yearning for truth, and
worldly folly, were playing a game of battledore and shuttlecock,
and I was the feathered cork.&nbsp; There is a song without words
by Mendelssohn, which sets forth as clearly as Shakespeare or
Heine could have done in words, deep melancholy or unavoidable
suffering expressing itself merrily and gaily in a manner which
is both touching and beautiful, or sweet and sad.&nbsp; Without
any self-consciousness or display of sentimentalism, I find deep
traces of this in many little poems or sketches which I wrote at
that time, and which have now been forgotten.&nbsp; I had been in
Arcadia; I was now in a very pleasant sunny Philistia; but I
could not forget the past.&nbsp; And I never forgot it.&nbsp;
Once in Paris, in the opera, I used in jest emphatically the
Russian word <i>harrascho</i>, &ldquo;good,&rdquo; when a Russian
stranger in the next box smiled joyously, and rising, waved his
glove to me.&nbsp; Once in a brilliant soir&eacute;e in
Philadelphia there was a Hungarian Count, an exile, and talking
with him in English, I let fall for a joke &ldquo;<i>Bassama
terem-tete</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; He grasped my hand, and, forgetting
all around, entered into a long conversation.&nbsp; It was like
the American who, on finding an American cent in the streets in
Paris, burst into tears.&nbsp; So from time to time something
recalled Europe to me.</p>
<p>I went now and then to New York, which I liked better than
Philadelphia.&nbsp; I was often a guest of Mr. Kimball.&nbsp; He
introduced me to Dr. Rufus Griswold, a strange character <!--
page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>and a noted man of letters.&nbsp; He was to his death
so uniformly a friend to me, and so untiring in his efforts to
aid me, that I cannot find words to express his kindness nor the
gratitude which I feel.&nbsp; He became the editor of a literary
magazine which was really far in advance of the time.&nbsp; It
did not last long; while it endured I supplied for it monthly
reviews of foreign literature.</p>
<p>There were not many linguists on the American press in those
days, and my reviews of works in half-a-dozen languages induced
some one to pay a high compliment to the editor.&nbsp; It was
Bayard Taylor, I believe, who, hearing this, declared honestly,
and as a friend, that I alone deserved the credit.&nbsp; This was
repeated by some one to Dr. Griswold in such a form that he
thought <i>I</i> had been talking against him, though I had never
spoken to a soul about it.&nbsp; The result was that the Doctor
promptly dismissed me, and I felt hurt.&nbsp; Mr. Kimball met me
and laughed, saying, &ldquo;The next time you meet the Doctor
just go resolutely at him and <i>replace yourself</i>.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t allow him a word.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, meeting Dr.
Griswold a few days after in Philadelphia, I went boldly up and
said, &ldquo;You must come at once with me and take a
drink&mdash;immediately!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Doctor went like a
lamb&mdash;not to the slaughter, but to its milk&mdash;and when
he had drunk a comforting grog, I attacked him boldly, and
declared that I had never spoken a word to a living soul as to
the authorship of the reviews&mdash;which was perfectly true, for
I never broke the golden rule of &ldquo;contributorial
anonymity.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the Doctor put me on the staff
again.&nbsp; But to the end of his life I was always with him a
privileged character, and could take, if I chose, the most
extraordinary liberties, though he was one of the most irritable
and vindictive men I ever met, if he fancied that he was in any
way too familiarly treated.</p>
<p>Kossuth came to America, and I was almost squeezed to
death&mdash;right against a pretty German girl&mdash;in the crowd
at his reception in Philadelphia.&nbsp; At the dinner in New York
<!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>I met at Kimball&rsquo;s house Franz Pulszky, and sat
by his wife.&nbsp; I have since seen him many times in
Buda-Pest.</p>
<p>There lived in Philadelphia a gentleman named Rodney
Fisher.&nbsp; He had been for many years a partner in an English
house in Canton, and also lived in England.&nbsp; He had long
been an intimate friend of Russel Sturgis, subsequently of
&ldquo;Baring Brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a grand-nephew of
C&aelig;sar Rodney, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, and a son of Judge Fisher, of Delaware.&nbsp; He
was a man of refined and agreeable manners and an admirable
relater of his innumerable experiences in Europe and the
East.&nbsp; His wife had been celebrated for her beauty.&nbsp;
When I first met her in her own house she seemed to me to be
hardly thirty years of age, and I believed at first she was one
of her own daughters.&nbsp; She was without exception the most
amiable, I may say lovable person whom I ever met, and I never
had a <i>nuance</i> or shade of difference of opinion with her,
or know an instant during which I was not devoted to her.&nbsp; I
visited his house and fell in love with his daughter Belle, to
whom I became, after about a year, engaged.&nbsp; We were not,
however, married till five years after.&nbsp; Thackeray, whom I
knew well, said to a Mr. Curtis Raymond, of Boston, not long
before leaving for England, that she was the most beautiful woman
whom he had seen in America.&nbsp; I cannot help recording
this.</p>
<p>I need not say that, notwithstanding my terrible anxiety as to
my future, from this time I led a very happy life.&nbsp; There
was in Philadelphia a very wealthy lady called its Queen.&nbsp;
This was Mrs. James Rush.&nbsp; She had built the finest house in
our city, and placed in it sixty thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of
furniture.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>E un bel palazzo</i>!&rdquo; said an
Italian tenor one evening to me at a reception there.&nbsp; This
lady, who had read much, had lived long in Europe and &ldquo;knew
cities and men.&rdquo;&nbsp; To say that she was kind to me would
feebly express her kindness.&nbsp; It is true that we were by
much mutual knowledge rendered congenial.&nbsp; She invited <!--
page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>me to attend her weekly receptions, &amp;c., with Miss
Fisher.&nbsp; There we met and were introduced to all the
celebrated people who passed through Philadelphia.&nbsp; One
evening I had there, for instance, a conversation in German with
Mme. Sontag, the great singer, as with Jerome Bonaparte, the
nephew.</p>
<p>When the summer came I joined Mr. Fisher and his two
daughters&mdash;the second was named Mary&mdash;in a tour.&nbsp;
We went to New York, thence up the Hudson, and eastward to
Boston.&nbsp; After a day&rsquo;s travel we came to a town on the
frontier line, where we had to stop for two hours.&nbsp; Mr.
Fisher and I, being very thirsty and fatigued, went into a saloon
in which were two bars or counters.&nbsp; Advancing to the second
of these, I asked for brandy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t sell no
brandy here,&rdquo; replied the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is in
Massachusetts: go to the other bar&mdash;that is in New
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an instant we left New England for the
Middle States, and refreshed ourselves.&nbsp; Thence we went to
Springfield and saw the armoury, where guns are made.&nbsp;
Thence to Boston, where we stopped at a hotel.&nbsp; I went with
Miss Belle Fisher for a day&rsquo;s excursion to Dedham, where my
mother and sisters were on a visit.&nbsp; It was very
pleasant.</p>
<p>From Boston we went to Newport, and stayed at the Ocean
House.&nbsp; There I found Milton Sanford, a connection of mine
and a noted character.&nbsp; He had lived in Florence and known
Browning and his wife.&nbsp; He was, I believe, uncle of Miss
Kate Field.&nbsp; He introduced me to Colonel Colt, the
celebrated inventor or re-discoverer of the revolver; to Alf.
Jaell, a very great pianist; and Edward Marshall, a brother of
Humphrey Marshall.&nbsp; Sanford, Colt, Marshall, and I
patronised the pistol-gallery every day, nor did we abstain from
mint-juleps.&nbsp; I found that, in shooting, Colonel Colt could
beat me <i>at the word</i>, but that I always had the best of it
at a deliberate &ldquo;take-your-time&rdquo; shot.&nbsp; There,
too, were the two brothers Burnett, whom I had met long before in
Heidelberg.&nbsp; What with <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>drives and
balls and other gaiety, the time passed pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>As I spoke German, I became intimate with Jaell.&nbsp; He
could not sing at all.&nbsp; Once I suggested to him that he
should compose variations on an air, a German popular song.&nbsp;
For a day or two he hummed it as well as he could.&nbsp; On the
third morning he took me into a room where there was a piano, and
asked me to sing while he played accompaniments.&nbsp; All at
once he said, &ldquo;Stop! I have got it!&rdquo; and then he
played the air with marvellously beautiful variations.&nbsp; He
was a great genius, but I never heard him play in public as he
played then.&nbsp; He was in a &ldquo;high hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was wonderful.&nbsp; I may here say that in after years, while
living at a hotel, I became well acquainted with Thalberg, and
especially with Ole Bull, the violinist, who told me much about
Heine.</p>
<p>So time rolled on for three years.&nbsp; I passed my
examination and took an office in Third Street, with a sign
proclaiming that I was attorney-at-law and <i>Avokat</i>.&nbsp;
During six months I had two clients and made exactly three
pounds.&nbsp; Then, the house being wanted, I left and gave up
law.&nbsp; This was a very disheartening time for me.&nbsp; I had
a great many friends who could easily have put collecting and
other business in my hands, but none of them did it.&nbsp; I felt
this very keenly.&nbsp; Quite apart from a young man&rsquo;s
pushing himself, despite every obstacle, there is the great truth
that sometimes the obstacles or bad luck become
insuperable.&nbsp; Mine did at this time.</p>
<p>The author of &ldquo;Gossip of the Century&rdquo; has well
remarked that &ldquo;it has been said that however quickly a
clever lad may have run up the ladder, whether of fame or
fortune, it will always be found that he was lucky enough to find
some one who put his foot on the first rung.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
is perfectly true, as I soon found, if not in law, at least in
literature.</p>
<p>I went more than once to New York, hoping to obtain literary
employment.&nbsp; One day Dr. Rufus Griswold came to <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>me
in great excitement.&nbsp; Mr. Barnum&mdash;the great
showman&mdash;and the Brothers Beech were about to establish a
great illustrated weekly newspaper, and he was to be the editor
and I the assistant.&nbsp; It is quite true that he had actually
taken the post, for which he did not care twopence, only to
provide a place for me, and he had tramped all over New York for
hours in a fearful storm to find me and to announce the good
news.</p>
<p>Then work began for me in tremendous earnest.&nbsp; Let the
reader imagine such a paper as the London <i>Illustrated News</i>
with one editor and one assistant!&nbsp; Three men could not have
read our exchanges, and I was expected to do that and all the
minor casual writing for cuts, or cutting down and occasional
outside work.&nbsp; And yet even Mr. Barnum, who should have had
more sense, one day, on coming in, expressed his amazement on
seeing about a cartload of country exchanges which I had not
opened.&nbsp; But there was something in Philadelphia which made
all work seem play to me, and I long laboured from ten in the
morning till midnight.&nbsp; My assiduity attracted
attention.</p>
<p>Dr. Griswold was always a little &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; and I
used to scold and reprove him for it.&nbsp; He had got himself
into great trouble by his remarks on Edgar A. Poe.&nbsp; Mr.
Kimball and others, who knew the Doctor, believed, as I do, that
there was no deliberate evil or envy in those remarks.&nbsp;
Poe&rsquo;s best friends told severe stories of him in those
days&mdash;<i>me ipso teste</i>&mdash;and Griswold, naught
extenuating and setting down naught in malice, wrote incautiously
more than he should.&nbsp; These are the words of another than
I.&nbsp; But when Griswold was attacked, then he became
savage.&nbsp; One day I found in his desk, which he had committed
to me, a great number of further material collected to
Poe&rsquo;s discredit.&nbsp; I burnt it all up at once, and told
the Doctor what I had done, and scolded him well into the
bargain.&nbsp; He took it all very amiably.&nbsp; There was also
much more matter to other men&rsquo;s
discredit&mdash;<i>ascensionem expectans</i>&mdash;awaiting
publication, all of which I <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>burned.&nbsp; It was the result of long research, and
evidently formed the material for a book.&nbsp; Had it ever been
published, it would have made Rome howl!&nbsp; But, as I said, I
was angry, and I knew it would injure Dr. Griswold more than
anybody.&nbsp; It is a pity that I had not always had the Doctor
in hand&mdash;though I must here again repeat that, as regards
Poe, he is, in my opinion, not so much to blame as a score of
writers have made out.&nbsp; The tales, which were certainly most
authentic, or at least apparently so, during the life of the
latter, among his best friends regarding him, were, to say the
least, discreditable, albeit that is no excuse whatever for
publishing them.&nbsp; I have always much disliked the popular
principle of judging men&rsquo;s works entirely by their lives,
and deciding against the literary merit of <i>Sartor Resartus</i>
because Carlyle put his wife&rsquo;s money to his own account
<i>in banco</i>.</p>
<p>And it is, moreover, cruel that a man, because he has been a
poet or genius or artist, must needs have every weakness (real or
conjectured) in his life served up and grinned at and chatted
over, as if he forsooth were a clergyman or some kind of
make-believe saint.&nbsp; However, the more vulgar a nature is
the more it will gloat on gossip; and herein the most pretentious
of the higher classes show themselves no better than the
basest.</p>
<p>I lived at Dan Bixby&rsquo;s, at the corner of Park Place and
Broadway, where I came very near being shot one night by a man
who mistook me, or rather my room, for that of the one below, in
which his wife was, or had been, with another person.&nbsp; Being
very tipsy, the injured individual went one storey too high, and
tried to burst in to shoot me with a revolver, but I repelled him
after a severe struggle, in which I had sharp work to avoid being
shot.&nbsp; I would much rather fight a decent duel any time than
have such a &ldquo;hog-fight.&rdquo;&nbsp; I only had a loaded
cane.&nbsp; The worst of it was that the injured husband, having
traced his wife, as he erroneously thought, to my room, went to
Bixby and the clerk, and asked who lived in it.&nbsp; But as they
were my friends, they dismissed <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>him
gruffly, yet believed all the same that <i>I</i> had &ldquo;a
petticoat in my wardrobe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence for a week all my
friends kept making cruel allusions in my presence to gay
deceivers and Don Juan <i>et cetera</i>, until in a rage I asked
what the devil it all meant, when there was an explanation by a
clergyman, and I swore myself clear.&nbsp; But I thought it was
hard lines to have to stand the revolver, endure all the scandal
for a week, and be <i>innocent</i> all the time withal!&nbsp;
That was indeed bitter in the cup!</p>
<p>Apropos of this small affair, I can recall a droll scene,
<i>de eodem genere</i>, which I witnessed within a week of the
other.&nbsp; There was a rather first-class saloon, bar, and
restaurant on Broadway, kept by a good-looking
pugilistic-associated individual named George Shurragar.&nbsp; As
he had black eyes, and was a shoulder-hitter, and as the name in
Romany means &ldquo;a captain,&rdquo; I daresay he was partly
gypsy.&nbsp; And, when weary with editorial work, I sometimes
dropped in there for refreshment.&nbsp; One night an elderly,
vulgar individual, greatly exalted by many brandies, became
disorderly, and drawing a knife, made a grand Malay charge on all
present, <i>&agrave; la mok</i>.&nbsp; George Shurragar promptly
settled him with a blow, disarmed him, and &ldquo;fired him
out&rdquo; into outer darkness.&nbsp; Then George exhibited the
knife.&nbsp; It was such a dirty, disreputable-looking
&ldquo;pig-sticker,&rdquo; that we were all disgusted, and George
cast it with contempt into the street.&nbsp; Does the reader
remember the scene in &ldquo;The Bohemian Girl&rdquo; in which
the dandy Count examines the nasty knife left behind by the gypsy
Devilshoof?&nbsp; It was the very counterpart of this, the
difference being that in this case it was the gypsy who despised
the instrument.</p>
<p>Such trivial amusing incidents and rencontres as these were
matters of almost daily occurrence to me in those days, and I
fear that I incur the reproach of padding by narrating
these.&nbsp; Yet, as I write this, I have just read in the
&ldquo;Life of Benvenuto Cellini&rdquo; that he too omits the
description of a lot of exactly such adventures, as being, like
the darkey&rsquo;s imprisonments <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>for
stealing, &ldquo;not worf mentionin&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and
confess I felt great regret that he did so; for there is always a
great deal of local and temporal colour in anything whose proper
<i>finale</i> should be in a police-court.</p>
<p>Hawthorne used to stay at Bixby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was a moody
man, who sat by the stove and spoke to no one.&nbsp; Bixby had
been a publisher, and was proud that he had first issued
Hayward&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; in America.&nbsp; He was also
proud that his hotel was much frequented by literary men and
naval officers.&nbsp; He was very kind to me.&nbsp; Once when I
complained to the clerk that the price of my rooms was too high,
he replied, &ldquo;Mr. Leland, the prices of all the rooms in the
house, excepting yours, were raised long ago, and Mr. Bixby
charged me strictly <i>not to let you know it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Uncle Daniel was a gentleman, and belonged to my club&mdash;the
Century.&nbsp; When he grew older he lived on an annuity, and was
a great and privileged favourite among actresses and
singers.&nbsp; Thirty years later I called with him in New York
on Ada Cavendish.</p>
<p>After a fortnight or so, Dr. Griswold began to be very
erratic.&nbsp; He had a divorce case going on in
Philadelphia.&nbsp; He went off, assuring me that everything was
in order, and never returned.&nbsp; The foreman came to me saying
that there was no copy, and nothing ready, and everything
needed.&nbsp; Here was indeed a pretty kettle of fish!&nbsp; For
I at that time absolutely distrusted my own ability to do all the
work.&nbsp; I flew to Kimball, who said, &ldquo;Just put it
through by strong will, and you&rsquo;ll succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I went to Mr. Barnum&mdash;Uncle Barnum&mdash;who was
always &ldquo;as good as gold&rdquo; to me.&nbsp; I burst out
into a statement of my griefs, mentioning incidentally that I
really could not go on as full editor, and do such fearful work
on the salary of an office-boy.&nbsp; He listened to it all, I am
sure with amusement, and placing his hand kindly on my shoulder
as we walked up and down the hall of the Museum, said, &ldquo;You
<i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> go.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t get into a
funk.&nbsp; I know that you <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>can do the
work, and do it <i>well</i>.&nbsp; And the salary shall be
doubled&mdash;certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the paper was brought out after all.&nbsp; I had great
trouble for some time to learn to write editorials.&nbsp; I used
to go to the office of a Sunday morn, and sit sometimes from ten
till two turning over the exchanges, and seeking for ideas.&nbsp;
It was a dreadful ordeal.&nbsp; In fact, in after times it was
several years before I could seize a pen, rattle up a subject and
dash off a leader.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> I can write far more easily
than I can talk.&nbsp; And it is a curious fact that soon after I
became really skilled at such extempore work in the opinion of
the best judges, such as Raymond, I no longer had any opportunity
to practice it.</p>
<p>I had worked only a week or two when a rather queer, tall,
roughish Yankee was brought into the office.&nbsp; He worked for
a while, and in a day or two took possession of my desk and
rudely informed me that he was my superior editor and master
there.&nbsp; He had, as many men do, mistaken amiable politeness
for humility.&nbsp; I replied, knowing that Mr. Beech, out of
sight, was listening to every word, that there was no master
there but Mr. Beech, and that I should keep my desk.&nbsp; We
became affable; but I abode my time, for I found that he was
utterly incompetent to do the work.&nbsp; Very soon he told me
that he had an invitation to lecture in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I
told him that if he wished to go I would do all his work for
him.&nbsp; So he went, and Mr. Beech coming in, asked where Mr.
--- was.&nbsp; I replied that he had gone away to lecture, and
that I was to do his work during his absence.&nbsp; This was
really too much, and the Yankee was dismissed &ldquo;in short
order,&rdquo; the Beeches being men who made up their minds
promptly and acted vigorously.&nbsp; As for me, I never, shirked
work of any kind.&nbsp; A gentleman on a newspaper never
does.&nbsp; The more of a snob a man is, the more afraid he is of
damaging his dignity, and the more desirous of being
&ldquo;boss&rdquo; and captain.&nbsp; But though I have terribly
scandalised my chief or proprietor by reporting a fire, <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>I
never found that I was less respected by the typos, reporters,
and subs.</p>
<p>I had before leaving Philadelphia published two books.&nbsp;
One was &ldquo;The Poetry and Mystery of Dreams,&rdquo; which I
dedicated to my fianc&eacute;e, Miss Belle Fisher.&nbsp; The
other was an odd m&eacute;lange, which had appeared in chapters
in the <i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It was titled
<i>Meister Karl&rsquo;s Sketch-Book</i>.&nbsp; It had no great
success beyond attaining to a second edition long after; yet
Washington Irving praised it to everybody, and wrote to me that
he liked it so much that he kept it by him to nibble ever and
anon, like a Stilton cheese or a <i>pat&eacute; de foie gras</i>;
and here and there I have known men, like the late Nicolas
Tr&uuml;bner or E. L. Bulwer, who found a strange attraction in
it, but it was emphatically caviare to the general reader.&nbsp;
It had at least a <i>style</i> of its own, which found a few
imitators.&nbsp; It ranks, I think, about <i>pari passu</i> with
Coryatt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crudities,&rdquo; or lower.</p>
<p>There were two or three salons in New York where there were
weekly literary receptions, and where one could meet the
principal writers of the time.&nbsp; I often saw at
Kimball&rsquo;s and other places the Misses Wetherell, who wrote
the &ldquo;Wide, Wide World&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Queechy.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were elderly, and had so very
little of the &ldquo;world&rdquo; in their ways, that they
occurred to me as an example of the fact that people generally
write most on what they know least about.&nbsp; Thus a Lowell
factory-girl likes to write a tale of ducal society in England;
and when a Scotchman has less intelligence of &ldquo;jocks&rdquo;
and &ldquo;wut&rdquo; than any of his countrymen, he compiles,
and comments on, American humorists.</p>
<p>Once there was a grand publishers&rsquo; dinner to authors
where I went with Alice and Ph&oelig;be Carey, who were great
friends of mine.&nbsp; There I met and talked with Washington
Irving; I remember Bryant and N. P. Willis, <i>et tous les
autres</i>.&nbsp; Just at that time wine, &amp;c., could only be
sold in New York &ldquo;in the original packages as
imported.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alice or Ph&oelig;be Carey lamented that
we were to have none at the <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>banquet.&nbsp; There was a large dish of grapes before
her, and I said, &ldquo;Why, there you have plenty of it in the
original packages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time very hospitable or genial hosts used to place a
bottle of brandy and glass in the gentlemen&rsquo;s dressing-room
at an evening&rsquo;s reception, and I remember it was considered
a scandalous thing when a certain old retired naval officer once
emptied the whole bottle single-handed.</p>
<p>Of course I was very intimate with Clark of the
<i>Knickerbocker</i>, Fred Cozzens, John Godfrey Saxe, and all
the company of gay and festive humorists who circled about that
merry magazine.&nbsp; There was never anything quite like the
<i>Knickerbocker</i>, and there never will be again.&nbsp; It
required a sunny, genial social atmosphere, such as we had before
the war, and never after; an easy writing of gay and cultivated
men for one another, and not painfully elaborating jocosities or
seriosities for the million as in&mdash;But never mind.&nbsp; It
sparkled through its summer-time, and oh! how its readers loved
it!&nbsp; I sometimes think that I would like to hunt up the old
title-plate with Diedrich Knickerbocker and his pipe, and issue
it again every month to a few dozen subscribers who loved quaint
odds and ends, till I too should pass away!</p>
<p>It was easy enough to foresee that a great illustrated weekly,
with actually one young man, and generally no more, to do all the
literary work could not last long.&nbsp; And yet the <i>New York
Times</i>, or some such journal, said that the work was very well
done, and that the paper did well until I left.&nbsp; Heaven
knows that I worked hard enough on it, and, what was a great deal
to boast of in those days, never profited one farthing beyond
free tickets to plays, which I had little time to use.&nbsp; And
yet my pay was simply despicably small.&nbsp; I had great
temptations to write up certain speculative enterprises, and
never accepted one.&nbsp; Our circulation sometimes reached
150,000.&nbsp; And if the publishers (excepting Barnum) had ever
shown me anything like thanks or kindness for gratuitous zeal and
interest which I took, I could <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>have
greatly aided them.&nbsp; One day, for instance, I was asked to
write a description of a new ferry.&nbsp; I went there, and the
proprietor intimated that he would pay a large sum for an article
which would point out the advantage or profit which would accrue
from investing in his lots.&nbsp; I told him that if it were
really true that such was the case, I would do it for nothing,
but that I never made money behind my salary.&nbsp; I began to
weary of the small Yankee greed and griping and
&ldquo;thanklessness&rdquo; which I experienced.&nbsp; There were
editors in New York who, for less work, earned ten times the
salary which I received.&nbsp; I was not sorry when I heard that
some utterly inexperienced New England clergyman had been engaged
to take my place.&nbsp; So I returned to Philadelphia.&nbsp; The
paper very soon came to grief.&nbsp; I believe that with Barnum
alone I could have made it a great success.&nbsp; We had Frank
Leslie for chief engraver, and he was very clever and
ambitious.&nbsp; I had a knowledge of art, literature, and
foreign life and affairs, which could have been turned, with
Leslie&rsquo;s co-operation, to great advantage.&nbsp; I needed
an office with a few books for reference, at least three or four
literary aids, and other ordinary absolutely necessary facilities
for work.&nbsp; All that I literally had was a space
half-portioned off from the engine-room, where a dozen blackguard
boys swore and yelled as it were at my elbow, a desk, a chair,
and a pair of scissors, ink, and paste.&nbsp; This wretched
scrimping prevailed through the whole business, and thus it was
expected to establish a great first-class American illustrated
newspaper.&nbsp; It is sometimes forgotten in the United States
that to make a vast success, something is requisite beyond
enterprise and economy, and that it is a very poor policy to
screw your <i>employ&eacute;s</i> down to the last cent, and
overwork them, and make business needlessly irksome, when they
have it in their power to very greatly advance your
interests.&nbsp; I dwell on this because it is a common error
everywhere.&nbsp; I have in my mind a case in which an employer,
who lived &ldquo;like a prince,&rdquo; boasted to me how little
he paid his men, and how in the <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>long-run it
turned out bitterly to his loss in many ways.&nbsp; Those who had
no principle robbed him, while the honest, who would have made
his interests their own, left him.&nbsp; I have seen business
after business broken up in this way.&nbsp; While the principal
is in vigour and life, he may succeed with mere servants who are
poorly paid; then, after a time, some younger partner, who has
learned his morals from the master, pushes him out, or he dies,
and the business is worthless, because there is not a soul in it
who cares for it, or who has grown up with any common sense of
interest with the heirs.</p>
<p>I remember one day being obliged in New York to listen to a
conversation between two men of business.&nbsp; One owed the
other a large sum, honestly enough&mdash;of that there was no
question between them; but he thought that there was a legal way
to escape payment, while the other differed from him.&nbsp; So
they argued away for a long time.&nbsp; There was not a word of
reproach; the creditor would have cheated the debtor in the same
way if he could; the only point of difference was whether it
could be done.&nbsp; An <i>employ&eacute;</i> who can remain in
such surroundings and be honest must be indeed a miracle of
integrity, and, if he do not over-reach them in the long-run, one
of stupidity.&nbsp; I might have made &ldquo;house and
land&rdquo; out of the newspaper had I been so disposed.</p>
<p>Of all the men whom I met in those days in the way of
business, Mr. Barnum, the great American humbug, was by far the
honestest and freest from guile or deceit, or &ldquo;ways that
were dark, or tricks that were vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very
kind-hearted and benevolent, and gifted with a sense of fun which
was even stronger than his desire for dollars.&nbsp; I have
talked very confidentially with him many times, for he was very
fond of me, and always observed that to engineer some grotesque
and startling paradox into tremendous notoriety, to make
something <i>immensely</i> puzzling with a stupendous <i>sell</i>
as postscript, was more of a motive with him than even the main
chance.&nbsp; He was a genius like Rabelais, but one <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>who employed business and humanity for material instead
of literature, just as Abraham Lincoln, who was a brother of the
same band, employed patriotism and politics.&nbsp; All three of
them expressed vast problems, financial, intellectual, or
natural, by the brief arithmetic of a joke.&nbsp; Mr. Barnum was
fearfully busy in those days; what with buying elephants, wooing
two-headed girls for his Grand Combination, laying out towns,
chartering banks, and inventing unheard-of wonders for the
unrivalled collection of one hundred and fifty million
unparalleled moral marvels; but he always found time to act as
unpaid contributor to a column of humorous items which I always
published.&nbsp; I have said that I had no assistant; I forgot
that I always had Mr. Barnum as assistant humorous editor for
that department.&nbsp; All at once, when least expected, he would
come smiling in with some curiosity of literature such as the
&ldquo;reverse&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lewd did I live &amp; evil I did
dwel,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or a fresh conundrum or joke, with all his heart and soul full
of it, and he would be as delighted over the proof as if to see
himself in print was a startling novelty.&nbsp; We two had
&ldquo;beautiful times&rdquo; over that column, for there was a
great deal of &ldquo;boy&rdquo; still left in Barnum; nor was I
by any means deficient in it.&nbsp; One thing I set my face
against firmly: I never would in any way whatever write up, aid,
or advertise the great show or museum, or cry up the
elephant.&nbsp; I was resolved to leave the paper first.</p>
<p>On that humorous column Barnum always deferred to me, even as
a small school-boy defers to an elder on the question of a game
of marbles or hop-scotch.&nbsp; There was no affectation or play
in it; we were both quite in earnest.&nbsp; I think I see him
now, coming smiling in like a harvest-moon, big with some new
joke, and then we sat down at the desk and
&ldquo;edited.&rdquo;&nbsp; How we would sit and mutually and
admiringly read to one another our beautiful &ldquo;good
things,&rdquo; the world forgetting, by the world forgot!&nbsp;
And yet I declare <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>that never till this instant did the
great joke of it all ever occur to me&mdash;that two men of our
experiences could be so simply pleased!&nbsp; Those humorous
columns, collected and republished in a book, might truly bear on
the title-page, &ldquo;By Barnum and Hans Breitmann.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And we were both of the opinion that it really would make a very
nice book indeed.&nbsp; We were indeed both &ldquo;boys&rdquo;
over it at play.</p>
<p>The entire American press expected, as a matter of course,
that the <i>Illustrated News</i> would be simply an advertisement
for the great showman, and, as I represented to Mr. Barnum, this
would ere long utterly ruin the publication.&nbsp; I do not now
really know whether I was quite right in this, but it is very
much to Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s credit that he never insisted on it,
and that in his own paper he was conspicuous by his
absence.&nbsp; And here I will say that, measured by the highest
and most refined standard, there was more of the gentleman in
Phineas T. Barnum than the world imagined, and very much more
than there was in a certain young man in good society who once
expressed in my hearing disgust at the idea of even speaking to
&ldquo;the showman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher was a great friend of Barnum and the
Beaches, of which some one wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No wonder Mr. Alfred Beach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prefers, as noblest preacher,<br />
A man who is not only Beach,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But even more so&mdash;Beecher.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He came very frequently into our office; but I cannot recall
any saying of his worth recording.</p>
<p>There was also a brother of H. W. Longfellow, a clergyman, who
often visited me, of whom I retain a most agreeable
recollection.</p>
<p>The newsboys who clustered round the outer door were divided
in opinion as to me.&nbsp; One party thought I was Mr. Barnum,
and treated me with profound respect.&nbsp; The other faction
cried aloud after me, &ldquo;Hy! you --- ---!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Barnum wanted me to write his Life.&nbsp; This would <!--
page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>have been amusing work and profitable, but I shrunk
from the idea of being identified with it.&nbsp; I might as well
have done it, for I believe that Dr. Griswold performed the task,
and the public never knew or cared anything about it.&nbsp; But
my jolly companions at Dan Bixby&rsquo;s used to inquire of me at
what hour we fed the monkeys, and whether the Great Gyascutus
ever gave me any trouble; and I was sensitive to such
insinuations.</p>
<p>At this time Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s great moral curiosity was a
bearded lady, a jolly and not bad-looking Frenchwoman, whose
beard was genuine enough, as I know, having pulled it.&nbsp; My
own beard has been described by a French newspaper as <i>une
barbe de Charlemagne</i>, a very polite pun, but hers was much
fuller.&nbsp; It was soft as floss silk.&nbsp; After a while the
capillary attraction ceased to draw, and Mr. Barnum thought of an
admirable plan to revive it.&nbsp; He got somebody to prosecute
him for false pretences and imposture, on the ground that Madame
was a man.&nbsp; Then Mr. Barnum had, with the greatest
unwillingness and many moral apologies, a medical examination;
they might as sensibly have examined Vashishta&rsquo;s cow to
find out if it was an Irish bull.&nbsp; Then came the attack on
the impropriety of the whole thing, and finally Mr.
Barnum&rsquo;s triumphant surrebutter, showing he had most
unwillingly been <i>goaded</i> by the attacks of malevolent
wretches into an unavoidable course of defence.&nbsp; Of course,
spotless innocence came out triumphant.&nbsp; Mr. Barnum&rsquo;s
system of innocence was truly admirable.&nbsp; When he had
concocted some monstrous cock-and-bull curiosity, he was wont to
advertise that &ldquo;it was with very great reluctance that he
presented this unprecedented marvel to the world, as doubts had
been expressed as to its genuineness&mdash;doubts inspired by the
actually apparently incredible amount of attraction in it.&nbsp;
All that we ask of an enlightened and honest public is, that it
will pass a fair verdict and decide whether it be a humbug or
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the enlightened public paid its quarters of
a dollar, and decided that it <i>was</i> a humbug, and Barnum
abode by their <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>decision, and then sent it to
another city to be again decided on.</p>
<p>I returned to Philadelphia, and to my father&rsquo;s house,
and occupied myself with such odds and ends of magazine and other
writing as came in my way, and always reading and studying.&nbsp;
I was very much depressed at this time, yet not daunted.&nbsp; My
year in New York had familiarised me with characteristic phases
of American life and manners; my father thought I had gone
through a severe mill with rather doubtful characters, and once
remarked that I should not judge too harshly of business men, for
I had been unusually unfortunate in my experience.</p>
<p>A not unfrequent visitor at our house in Philadelphia was our
near neighbour, Henry C. Carey, the distinguished scholar and
writer on political economy, who had been so extensively robbed
of ideas by Bastiat, and who retook his own, not without
inflicting punishment.&nbsp; He was a handsome, black-eyed,
white-haired man, with a very piercing glance.&nbsp; During the
war, when men were sad and dull, and indeed till his death, Mr.
Carey&rsquo;s one glorious and friendly extravagance was to
assemble every Sunday afternoon all his intimates, including any
distinguished strangers, at his house, round a table, in rooms
magnificently hung with pictures, and give everybody, <i>ad
libitum</i>, hock which cost him sixteen shillings a
bottle.&nbsp; I occasionally obliged him by translating for him
German letters, &amp;c., and he in return revised my pamphlet on
Centralization <i>versus</i> State Rights in 1863.&nbsp; H. C.
Baird, a very able writer of his school, was his nephew.&nbsp;
The latter had two or three sisters, whom I recall as charming
girls while I was a law-student.&nbsp; There were many beauties
in Philadelphia in those days, and prominent at the time, though
as yet a schoolgirl, was the since far-famed Emily Schaumberg,
albeit I preferred Miss Belle Fisher, a descendant maternally of
the famous Callender beauties, and by her father&rsquo;s side
allied to Miss Vining, the American Queen of Beauty during the
Revolution at Washington&rsquo;s republican court.&nbsp; There
was also a <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Miss Lewis, whose great future
beauty I predicted while as yet a child, to the astonishment of a
few, &ldquo;which prophecy was marvellously
fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also a Miss Wharton, since deceased, on
whom George Boker after her death wrote an exquisite poem.&nbsp;
The two were, each of their kind, of a beauty which I have
rarely, if ever, seen equalled, and certainly never surpassed, in
Italy.&nbsp; How I could extend the list of those too good and
fair to live, who have passed away from my knowledge!&mdash;Miss
Nannie Grigg&mdash;Miss Julia Biddle!&mdash;<i>Mais o&ugrave;
sont les neiges d&rsquo;antan</i>?</p>
<p>Thus far my American experiences had not paid well.&nbsp; I
reflected that if I had remained in Paris I should have done far
better.&nbsp; When I left, I knew that the success of Louis
Napoleon was inevitable.&nbsp; Three newspapers devoted to him
had appeared on the Boulevards in one day.&nbsp; There was money
at work, and workmen such as lived in the H&ocirc;tel de
Luxembourg, gentlemen who could not only plan barricades but
fight at them, were in great demand, as <i>honest</i> men always
are in revolutions.&nbsp; Louis Napoleon was very anxious indeed
to attach to him the men of February, and many who had not done
one-tenth or one-twentieth of what I had, had the door of fortune
flung wide open to them.&nbsp; My police-<i>dossier</i> would
have been literally a diploma of honour under the new Empire,
for, after all, the men of February, Forty-eight, were the ones
who led off, and who all bore the highest reputation for
honour.&nbsp; All that I should have required would have been
some ambitious man of means to aid&mdash;and such men abound in
Paris&mdash;to have risen fast and high.&nbsp; As it turned out,
it was just as well in the end that I neither went in as a
political adventurer under Louis Napoleon, nor wrote the Life of
Barnum.&nbsp; But no one knew in those days how Louis would turn
out.</p>
<p>I have but one word to add to this.&nbsp; The secret of the
Revolution of February had been in very few hands, which was the
secret of its success.&nbsp; Any one of us could have secured
fortune and &ldquo;honours,&rdquo; or at least
&ldquo;orders,&rdquo; by betraying <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>it.&nbsp;
But we would as soon have secured orders for the pit of hell as
done so.&nbsp; This was known to Louis Napoleon, and he must have
realised who these men of iron integrity were for he was very
curious and inquiring on this subject.&nbsp; Now, I here claim it
as a great, as a surpassing honour for France, and as something
absolutely without parallel in history, that several hundred men
could be found who could not only keep this secret, but manage so
very wisely as they did.&nbsp; Louis Blanc was an example of
these honest, unselfish men.&nbsp; I came to know him personally
many years after, during his exile in London.</p>
<p>One morning George H. Boker came to me and informed me that
there was a writing editor wanted on the Philadelphia <i>Evening
Bulletin</i>.&nbsp; Its proprietor was Alexander Cummings.&nbsp;
The actual editor was Gibson Bannister Peacock, who was going to
Europe for a six months&rsquo; tour, and some one was wanted to
take his place.&nbsp; Mr. Peacock, as I subsequently found, was
an excellent editor, and a person of will and character.&nbsp; He
was skilled in music and a man of culture.&nbsp; I retain
grateful remembrances of him.&nbsp; I was introduced and
installed.&nbsp; With all my experience I had not yet quite
acquired the art of extemporaneous editorial composition.&nbsp;
My first few weeks were a severe trial, but I succeeded.&nbsp; I
was expected to write one column of leader every day, review
books, and &ldquo;paragraph&rdquo; or condense articles to a
brief item of news.&nbsp; In which I succeeded so well, that some
time after, when a work appeared on writing for the press, the
author, who did not know me at all, cited one of my leaders and
one of my paragraphs as models.&nbsp; It actually made little
impression on me at the time&mdash;I was so busy.</p>
<p>I had been at work but a short time, when one day Mr. Cummings
received a letter from Mr. Peacock in Europe, which he certainly
had hardly glanced at, which he threw to me to read.&nbsp; I did
so, and found in it a passage to this effect: &ldquo;I am sorry
that you are disappointed as to Mr. Leland, but I am confident
that you will find him perfectly capable in <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>time.&rdquo;&nbsp; This gave me a bitter pang, but I
returned it to Mr. Cummings, who soon after came into the office
and expressed frankly his great regret, saying that since he had
written to Mr. Peacock he had quite changed his opinion.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this new life to the utmost.&nbsp; Mr. Cummings, to
tell the truth, pursued a somewhat tortuous course in politics
and religion.&nbsp; He was a Methodist.&nbsp; One day our clerk
expressed himself as to the latter in these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;They say he is a Jumper, but others think he
has gone over to the Holy Rollers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jumpers were
a sect whose members, when the Holy Spirit seized them, jumped up
and down, while the Holy Rollers under such circumstances rolled
over and over on the floor.&nbsp; We also advocated Native
Americanism and Temperance, which did not prevent Mr. Peacock and
myself and a few <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the office from going
daily at eleven o&rsquo;clock to a neighbouring lager-beer
<i>Wirthschaft</i> for a refreshing glass and lunch.&nbsp; One
day the bar-tender, Hermann, a very nice fellow, said to me,
&ldquo;I remember when you always had a bottle of Rudesheimer
every day for dinner.&nbsp; That was at Herr Lehr&rsquo;s, in
Heidelberg.&nbsp; I always waited on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whoever shall write a history of Philadelphia from the
Thirties to the end of the Fifties will record a popular period
of turbulence and outrages so extensive as to now appear almost
incredible.&nbsp; These were so great as to cause grave doubts in
my mind whether the severest despotism, guided by justice, would
not have been preferable to such republican license as then
prevailed in the city of Penn.&nbsp; I refer to the absolute and
uncontrolled rule of the Volunteer Fire Department, which was
divided into companies (each having clumsy old fire apparatus and
hose), all of them at deadly feud among themselves, and fighting
freely with pistols, knives, iron spanners, and slung shot,
whenever they met, whether at fires or in the streets.&nbsp; Of
these regular firemen, <i>fifty thousand</i> were enrolled, and
to these might have been added almost as many more, who were
known as runners, <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>bummers, and hangers-on.&nbsp; Among
the latter were a great number of incendiaries, all of whom were
well known to and encouraged by the firemen.&nbsp; Whenever the
latter wished to meet some rival company, either to test their
mutual skill or engage in a fight, a fire was sure to occur; the
same always happened when a fire company from some other city
visited Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This gave occasion to an incredible amount of blackmailing,
since all house-owners were frequently called on to contribute
money to the different companies, sometimes as a subscription for
ball-tickets or repairs.&nbsp; It was well understood, and
generally pretty plainly expressed, that those who refused to pay
might expect to be burned out or neglected.&nbsp; The result of
it all was a general fear of the firemen, a most degrading and
contemptible subservience to them by politicians of all kinds, a
terrible and general growth and spread of turbulence and coarse
vulgarity among youth, and finally, such a prevalence of
conflagration that no one who owned a house could hear the awful
tones of the bell of Independence Hall without terror.&nbsp;
Fires were literally of nightly occurrence, and that they were
invariably by night was due to the incendiary
&ldquo;runner.&rdquo;&nbsp; A slight examination of the
newspapers and cheap broadside literature of that time will amply
confirm all that I here state.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jakey&rdquo; was the
typical fireman; he was the brutal hero of a vulgar play, and the
ideal of nineteen youths out of twenty.&nbsp; For a generation or
more all society felt the degrading influences of this rowdyism
in almost every circle&mdash;for there were among the vast
majority of men not very many who respected, looked up to, or
cared for anything really cultured or refined.&nbsp; I have a
large collection of the popular songs of Philadelphia of that
time, in all of which there is a striving downwards into
blackguardism and brutality, vileness and ignorance, which has no
parallel in the literature of any other nation.&nbsp; The French
of the <i>P&egrave;re Duch&ecirc;ne</i> school may be nastier,
and, as regards aristocrats, as bloody, but for general all-round
<i>vulgarity</i>, the state <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>of morals
developed among the people at the time of which I speak was
literally without its like.&nbsp; It is very strange that Pliny
also speaks of the turbulence or rowdyism of the firemen of
Rome.</p>
<p>I remember that even in Walnut Street, below Thirteenth
Street, before my father&rsquo;s house (this being then by far
the most respectable portion of Philadelphia), it happened
several nights in succession that rival fire-companies, running
side by side, fought as they ran, with torches and knives, while
firing pistols.&nbsp; There was a young lady named Mary Bicking,
who lived near us.&nbsp; I asked her one day if she had ever seen
a man shot; and when she answered &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look out of your window some night and
see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The southern part of the city was a favourite battleground,
and I can remember hearing ladies who lived in Pine Street
describe how, on Sunday summer afternoons, they could always
hear, singly or in volleys, the shots of the revolvers and shouts
of the firemen as they fought in Moyamensing.</p>
<p>Every effort to diminish these evils, or to improve the fire
department in any way whatever, was vigorously opposed by the
rowdies, who completely governed the city.&nbsp; The first
fire-alarm electric telegraphs were a great offence to firemen,
and were quietly destroyed; the steam-engines were regarded by
them as deadly enemies.&nbsp; But the first great efficient
reform in the Philadelphia fire department, and the most radical
of all, was the establishment of a fire-detective department
under a fire-marshal, whose business it was to investigate and
punish all cases of incendiarism.&nbsp; For it was simply
incendiarism, encouraged and supported by the firemen themselves,
which caused nineteen-twentieths of all these disasters; it was
the <i>fires</i> which were the sole support of the whole
system.</p>
<p>I was much indebted for understanding all this, and acting on
it boldly, as I did, to the city editor and chief reporter <!--
page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>on the <i>Evening Bulletin</i>, Caspar Souder.&nbsp;
The Mayor of the city was Richard Vaux, a man of good family and
education, and one who had seen in his time cities and men, he
having once in his youth, on some great occasion, waltzed with
the Princess&mdash;now Queen&mdash;Victoria.&nbsp; Being popular,
he was called <i>Vaux populi</i>.&nbsp; I wrote very often
leaders urging Mayor Vaux by name to establish a fire-detective
department.&nbsp; So great was the indignation caused among the
firemen, that I incurred no small risk in writing them.&nbsp; But
at last, when I published for one week an article every day
clamouring for a reform, Mayor Vaux&mdash;as he said directly to
Mr. Souder, &ldquo;in consequence of my
appeals&rdquo;&mdash;vigorously established a fire-marshal with
two aids.&nbsp; By my request, the office was bestowed on a very
intelligent and well-educated person, Dr. Blackburne, who had
been a surgeon in the Mexican war, then a reporter on our
journal, and finally a very clever superior detective.&nbsp; He
was really not only a born detective, but to a marked degree a
man of scientific attainments and a skilled statistician.&nbsp;
His anecdotes and comments as to pyromaniacs of different kinds
were as entertaining and curious as anything recorded by
Gaboriau.&nbsp; Some of the most interesting experiences of my
life were when I went with Dr. Blackburne from place to place
where efforts had been made to burn houses, and noted the
unerring and Red-Indian skill with which he distinguished the
style of work, and identified the persons and names of the
incendiaries.&nbsp; One of these &ldquo;fire-bugs&rdquo; was
noted for invariably setting fire to houses in such a manner as
to destroy as many inmates as possible.&nbsp; If there were an
exit, he would block it up.&nbsp; Dr. Blackburne took me to a
wooden house in which the two staircases led to a very small
vestibule about three feet square before the front door.&nbsp;
This space had been filled with diabolical ingenuity with a
barrel full of combustibles, so that every one who tried to
escape by the only opening below would be sure to perish.&nbsp;
Fortunately, the combustibles in the barrel went out after being
ignited.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>that fellow
by his style,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor, &ldquo;and I shall
arrest him at four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fire-detective department and the appointment of
Blackburne was the real basis and beginning of all the reforms
which soon followed, leading to the abolition of the volunteer
system and the establishment of paid
<i>employ&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp; And as I received great credit for
it then, my work being warmly recognised and known to all the
newspaper reporters and editors in the city, who were the best
judges of it, as they indeed are of all municipal matters, I
venture to record it here as something worth mentioning.&nbsp;
And though I may truly say that at the time I was so busy that I
made no account of many such things, they now rise up from time
to time as comforting assurances that my life has not been quite
wasted.</p>
<p>This reminds me that I had not been very long on the
newspaper, and had just begun to throw out editorials with ease,
when Mr. Cummings said to me one day that I did not realise what
a power I held in my hand, but that I would soon find it
out.&nbsp; Almost immediately after, in noticing some article or
book which was for sale at No. 24 Chestnut Street, I
inadvertently made reference to 24 Walnut Street.&nbsp; Very soon
came the proprietor of the latter place, complaining that I had
made life a burden to him, because fifty people had come in one
day to buy something which he had not.&nbsp; I reflected long and
deeply on this, with the result of observing that to influence
people it is not at all necessary to argue with them, but simply
be able to place before their eyes such facts as you
choose.&nbsp; It is very common indeed to hear people in England,
who should have more sense, declare that &ldquo;nobody minds what
the newspapers say.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the truth is, that if any
man has an eye to read and memory to retain, he <i>must</i>,
willy-nilly, be influenced by reading, and selection from others
by an able editor is often only a most ingenious and artful
method of arguing.&nbsp; It has very often happened to me, when I
wanted to enforce some important point, to <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>clothe it
as an anecdote or innocent &ldquo;item,&rdquo; and bid the
foreman set it in the smallest type in the most obscure
corner.&nbsp; And the reader is influenced by it, utterly
unconsciously, just as we all are, and just as surely as all
reflection follows sensation&mdash;as it ever will&mdash;into the
Ages!</p>
<p>There was much mutual robbing by newspapers of telegraphic
news in those days.&nbsp; Once it befell that just before the
<i>Bulletin</i> went to press a part of the powder-mills of
Dupont Brothers in Delaware blew up, and we received a few lines
of telegram, stating that Mr. Dupont himself had saved the great
magazine by actually walking on a burning building with buckets
of water, and preventing the fire from extending, at a most
incredible risk of his life.&nbsp; Having half-an-hour&rsquo;s
time, I expanded this telegram into something dramatic and
thrilling.&nbsp; A great New York newspaper, thinking, from the
shortness of time which elapsed in publishing, that it was all
telegraphed to us, printed it as one of its own from Delaware,
just as I had written it out&mdash;which I freely forgive, for
verily its review of my last work but one was such as to make me
inquire of myself in utter amazement, &ldquo;Can this be
I?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;so gloriously was I exalted to the higher
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result of this review was a sworn and firm
determination on my part to write another book of the same kind,
in which I should show myself more worthy of such cordial
encouragement; which latter book was the &ldquo;Etruscan
Legends.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ought indeed to have dedicated it to the
<i>New York Tribune</i>, a journal which has done more for human
freedom than any other publication in history.</p>
<p>I do not know certainly whether the brave Dupont whom I
mentioned was the Charley Dupont who went to school with me at
Jacob Pierce&rsquo;s, nor can I declare that a very gentlemanly
old Frenchman who came to see him in 1832 was his father or
grandfather, the famous old Dupont de l&rsquo;Eure of the French
Revolution.&nbsp; But I suppose it was the latter who carried and
transformed the art of manufacturing moral gunpowder in France to
the making material explosives <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>in
America.&nbsp; Yes, moral or physical, we are all but gunpowder
and smoke&mdash;<i>pulvis et umbra sumus</i>!</p>
<p>There was a morning paper in Philadelphia which grieved me
sore by pilfering my news items as I wrote them.&nbsp; So I one
day gave a marvellous account of the great Volatile Chelidonian
or Flying Turtle of Surinam, of which a specimen had just arrived
in New York.&nbsp; It had a shell as of diamonds blent with
emeralds and rubies, and bat-like wings of iridescent hue
surpassing the opal, and a tail like a serpent.&nbsp; Our
contemporary, nothing doubting, at once published this as
original matter in a letter from New York, and had to bear the
responsibility.&nbsp; But I did not invest my inventiveness
wisely; I should have shared the idea with Barnum.</p>
<p>There was in Philadelphia at this time a German bookseller
named Christern.&nbsp; It was the thought of honourable and
devoted men which recalled him to my mind.&nbsp; I had made his
acquaintance long before in Munich, where he had been employed in
the principal bookseller&rsquo;s shop of the city.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;store&rdquo; in Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, became a
kind of club, where I brought such of my friends as were
interested in German literature.&nbsp; We met there and talked
German, and examined and discussed all the latest European
works.&nbsp; He had a burly, honest, rather droll assistant named
Ruhl, who had been a student in Munich, then a Revolutionist and
exile, and finally a refugee to America.&nbsp; To this shop, too,
came Andr&eacute;kovitch, whom I had last known in Paris as a
speculator on the Bourse, wearing a cloak lined with
sables.&nbsp; In America he became a chemical manufacturer.&nbsp;
When at last an amnesty was proclaimed, his brother asked him to
return to Poland, promising a support, which he declined.&nbsp;
He too was an honourable, independent man.&nbsp; About this time
the great&mdash;I forget his name; or was it
Sch&ouml;ffel?&mdash;who had been President of the Frankfort
Revolutionary Parliament, opened a lager-beer establishment in
Race Street.&nbsp; I went there several times with Ruhl.</p>
<p>George Boker and Frank Wells, who subsequently succeeded <!--
page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>me on the <i>Bulletin</i>, would drop in every day
after the first edition had gone to press, and then there would
be a lively time.&nbsp; Frank Wells was, <i>par
&eacute;minence</i>, the greatest punster Philadelphia ever
produced.&nbsp; He was in this respect appalling.&nbsp; We had a
sub-editor or writer named Ernest Wallace, who was also a clever
humorist.&nbsp; One day John Godfrey Saxe came in.&nbsp; He was
accustomed among country auditors and in common sanctums to carry
everything before him with his jokes.&nbsp; In half-an-hour we
extinguished him.&nbsp; Having declared that no one could make a
pun on his name, which he had not heard before, Wallace promptly
replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>axing</i> too much, I presume; but
did you ever hear <i>that</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Saxe owned that he
had not.</p>
<p>George H. Boker, whose name deserves a very high place in
American literature as a poet, and in history as one who was of
incredible service, quietly performed, in preserving the Union
during the war, was also eminently a wit and humorist.&nbsp; We
always read first to one another all that we wrote.&nbsp; He had
so trained himself from boyhood to self-restraint, calmness, and
the <i>nil admirari</i> air, which, as Dallas said, is &ldquo;the
Corinthian ornament of a gentleman&rdquo; (I may add especially
when of Corinthian brass), that his admirable jests, while they
gained in clearness and applicability, lost something of that
rattle of the impromptu and headlong which renders Irish and
Western humour so easy.&nbsp; I recorded the <i>bon mots</i> and
merry stories which passed among us all in the <i>sanctum</i> in
articles for our weekly newspaper, under the name of
&ldquo;Social Hall Sketches&rdquo; (a social hall in the West is
a steamboat smoking-room).&nbsp; Every one of us received a
name.&nbsp; Mr. Peacock was Old Hurricane, and George Boker,
being asked what his pseudonym should be, selected that of
Bullfrog.&nbsp; These &ldquo;Social Hall Sketches&rdquo; had an
extended circulation in American newspapers, some for many
years.&nbsp; One entirely by me, entitled &ldquo;Opening
Oysters,&rdquo; is to be found in English almanacs, &amp;c., to
this day.</p>
<p>It was, I think, or am sure, in 1855 that some German in <!--
page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Pennsylvania, instead of burying his deceased wife,
burned the body.&nbsp; This called forth a storm of indignant
attack in the newspapers.&nbsp; It was called an irreligious,
indecent act.&nbsp; I wrote an editorial in which I warmly
defended it.&nbsp; According to Bulwer in the &ldquo;Last Days of
Pompeii,&rdquo; the early Christians practised it.&nbsp; Even to
this day Urns and torches are common symbols in Christian
burying-grounds, and we speak of &ldquo;ashes&rdquo; as more
decent than mouldering corpses.&nbsp; And, finally, I pointed out
the great advantage which it would be to the coal trade of
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; A man of culture said to me that it was the
boldest editorial which he had ever read.&nbsp; Such as it was, I
believe that it was the first article written in modern times
advocating cremation.&nbsp; If I am wrong, I am willing to be
corrected.</p>
<p>To those who are unfamiliar with it, the life in an American
newspaper office seems singularly eventful and striking.&nbsp; A
friend of mine who visited a sanctum (ours) for the first time,
said, as he left, that he had never experienced such an
interesting hour in his life.&nbsp; <i>Firstly</i>, came our
chief city reporter, exulting in the manner in which he had
circumvented the police, and, despite all their efforts, got, by
ways that were dark, at all the secrets of a brand-new horrible
murder.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, a messenger with an account of how
I, individually, had kicked up the very devil in the City
Councils, and set the Mayor to condemning us, by a leader
discussing certain municipal abuses.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>,
another, to tell how I had swept one-half the city by an article
exposing its neglect, and how the sweepers and dirt-carts were
busy where none had been before for weeks, and how the contractor
for cleaning wanted to shoot me.&nbsp; <i>Fourthly</i>, a visit
from some great dignitary, who put his dignity very much
<i>&agrave; l&rsquo;abri</i> in his pocket, to solicit a
puff.&nbsp; <i>Fifthly</i>, a lady who, having written a very
feeble volume of tales which had merely been gently commended in
our columns, came round in a rage to shame me by sarcasm, begging
me as a parting shot to at least <i>read</i> a few lines of her
work.&nbsp; <i>Sixthly</i>, a communication from a <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>great New York family, who, having been requested to
send a short description of a remarkable wedding-cake, sent me
<i>one hundred and fifty pages</i> of minute history of all their
ancestors and honours, with strict directions that not a line
should be omitted, and the article printed at once most
conspicuously. <a name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a>&nbsp; <i>Seventhly</i>, . . . but this
is a very mild specimen of what went on all the time during
office-hours.&nbsp; And on this subject alone I could write a
small book.</p>
<p>Now, at this time there came about a very great change in my
life, or an event which ultimately changed it altogether.&nbsp;
My father had, for about two years past, fallen into a very sad
state of mind.&nbsp; His large property between Chestnut and Bank
Streets paid very badly, and his means became limited.&nbsp; I
was seriously alarmed as to his health.&nbsp; My dear mother had
become, I may say, paralytic; but, in truth, the physicians could
never explain the disorder.&nbsp; To the last she maintained her
intellect, and a miraculous cheerfulness unimpaired.</p>
<p>All at once a strange spirit, as of new life, came suddenly
over my father.&nbsp; I cannot think of it without awe.&nbsp; He
went to work like a young man, shook off his despair, financiered
with marvellous ability, borrowed money, collected old and
long-despaired of debts, tore down the old hotel and the other
buildings, planned and bargained with architects&mdash;it was
then that I designed the fa&ccedil;ade before described&mdash;and
built six stores, two of them very handsome granite buildings, on
the old site.&nbsp; In short, he made of it a very valuable
estate.&nbsp; And as he superintended with great skill and
ability the smallest details of the building, which was for that
time remarkably well executed, I thought I recognised whence it
was that I derived the strongly developed tendency for
architecture which I have always possessed.&nbsp; I have since
made 400 copies of old churches in England.</p>
<p>This was a happy period, when life was without a cloud, <!--
page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>excepting my mother&rsquo;s trouble.&nbsp; As my father
could now well afford it, he made me an allowance, which, with my
earnings from the <i>Bulletin</i> and other occasional literary
work, justified me in getting married.&nbsp; I had had a long but
still very happy engagement.&nbsp; So we were married by the
Episcopal ceremony at the house of my father-in-law in Tenth
Street, and a very happy wedding it was.&nbsp; I remember two
incidents.&nbsp; Before the ceremony, the Reverend Mr.,
subsequently Bishop Wilmer, took me, with George Boker, into a
room and explained to me the symbolism of the
marriage-ring.&nbsp; Now, if there was a subject on earth which
I, the old friend of Creuzer of Heidelberg, and master of
Friedrich&rsquo;s <i>Symbolik</i>, and Durandus, and the work
&ldquo;On Finger-Rings,&rdquo; knew all about, it was
<i>that</i>; and I never shall forget the droll look which Boker
threw at me as the discourse proceeded.&nbsp; But I held my
peace, though sadly tempted to set forth my own
arch&aelig;ological views on the subject.</p>
<p>The second was this: Philadelphia, as Mr. Philipps has said,
abounds in folk-lore.&nbsp; Some one suggested that the wedding
would be a lucky one because there was only one clergyman
present.&nbsp; But I remarked that among our coloured waiters
there was one who had a congregation (my wife&rsquo;s cousin, by
the way, had a coloured bishop for coachman).&nbsp; However, this
sable cloud did not disturb us.</p>
<p>We went to New York, and were visited by many friends, and
returned to Philadelphia.&nbsp; We lived for the first year at
the La Pierre Hotel, where we met with many pleasant people, such
as Thackeray, Thalberg, Ole Bull, Mr. and Mrs. Choteau, of St.
Louis, and others.&nbsp; Of Thalberg I have already remarked, in
my notes to my translation of Heine&rsquo;s <i>Salon</i>, that he
impressed me as a very gentlemanly, dignified, and quietly
remarkable man, whom it would be difficult to readily or really
understand.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had unmistakably the manner peculiar
to many great Germans, which, as I have elsewhere observed, is
perceptible in the <i>maintien</i> and features of Goethe,
Humboldt, Bismarck,&rdquo; and Brugsch, of <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Berlin
(whom I learned to know in later years).&nbsp; Thalberg gave me
the impression, which grew on me, of a man who knew many things
besides piano-playing, and that he was born to a higher
specialty.&nbsp; He was dignified but affable.&nbsp; I remember
that one day, when he, or some one present, remarked that his
name was not a common one, I made him laugh by declaring that it
occurred in two pieces in an old German ballad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ich that am <span
class="smcap">Berge</span> stehen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und sohaute in das <span
class="smcap">Thal</span>;<br />
Da hab&rsquo; ich sie gesehen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Zum aller letzten mal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood upon the <i>mountain</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And looked the <i>valley</i> o&rsquo;er;<br />
There I indeed beheld her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But saw her never more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thalberg&rsquo;s playing was marvellously like his character
or himself: Heine calls it gentlemanly.&nbsp; Thackeray was
marked in his manner, and showed impulse and energy in small
utterances.&nbsp; I may err, but I do not think he could have
endured solitude or too much of himself.&nbsp; He was eminently
social, and rather given at times to reckless (not deliberate or
spiteful), sarcastic or &ldquo;ironic&rdquo; sallies, in which he
did not, with Americans, generally come off &ldquo;first
best.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a very beautiful lady in Boston with
whom the great novelist was much struck, and whom he greatly
admired, as he sent her two magnificent bronzes.&nbsp; Having
dined one evening at her house, he remarked as they all entered
the dining-room, &ldquo;Now I suppose that, according to your
American custom, we shall all put our feet up on the
chimney-piece.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied his
hostess, &ldquo;and as your legs are so much longer than the
others, you may put your feet on top of the looking-glass,&rdquo;
which was about ten feet from the ground.&nbsp; Thackeray, I was
told, was offended at this, and showed it; he being of the
&ldquo;give but not take&rdquo; kind.&nbsp; One day he said to
George Boker, when both were looking at D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s
etching <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of &ldquo;Death, Knight, and the
Devil,&rdquo; of which I possess a fine copy, &ldquo;Every man
has his devil whom he cannot overcome; I have two&mdash;laziness,
and love of pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remarked, &ldquo;Then why
the devil seek to overcome them?&nbsp; Is it not more noble and
sensible to yield where resistance is in vain, than to fight to
the end?&nbsp; Is it not a maxim of war, that he who strives to
defend a defenceless place must be put to death?&nbsp; Why not
give in like a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had just published my translation of Heine&rsquo;s
<i>Reisebilder</i>, and Bayard Taylor had a copy of it.&nbsp; He
went in company with Thackeray to New York, and told me
subsequently that they had read the work aloud between them
alternately with roars of laughter till it was finished; that
Thackeray praised my translation to the skies, and that his
comments and droll remarks on the text were delightful.&nbsp;
Thackeray was a perfect German scholar, and well informed as to
all in the book.</p>
<p>Apropos of Heine, Ole Bull had known him very well, and
described to me his brilliancy in the most distinguished literary
society, where in French the German wit bore away the palm from
all Frenchmen.&nbsp; &ldquo;He flashed and sprayed in brilliancy
like a fountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ole Bull by some chance had heard
much of me, and we became intimate.&nbsp; He told me that I had
unwittingly been to him the cause of great loss.&nbsp; I had,
while in London, become acquainted with an odd and rather scaly
fish, a German who had been a courier, who was the keeper of a
small caf&eacute; near Leicester Square, and who enjoyed a
certain fame as the inventor of the <i>poses plastiques</i> or
living statues, so popular in 1848.&nbsp; This man soon came over
to America, and called on me, wanting to borrow money, whereupon
I gave him the cold shoulder.&nbsp; According to Ole Bull, he
went to the great violinist, represented himself as my friend and
as warmly commended by me, and the heedless artist, instead of
referring to me directly, took him as impresario; the result
being that he ere long ran away with the money, and, what was
quite as bad, Ole Bull&rsquo;s prima-donna, who was, as I
understood, specially dear to him.&nbsp; Ole <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Bull&rsquo;s playing has been, as I think, much
underrated by certain writers of reminiscences.&nbsp; There was
in it a marvellous originality.</p>
<p>While I was there, in the La Pierre Hotel, the first great
meeting was held at which the Republican party was
organised.&nbsp; Though not an <i>appointed</i> delegate from our
State, I, as an editor, took some part in it.&nbsp; Little did we
foresee the tremendous results which were to ensue from that
meeting!&nbsp; It was second only to the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, and on it was based the greatest
struggle known to history.&nbsp; I could have, indeed, been
inscribed as a constitutional member of it for the asking or
writing my name, but that appeared to me and others then to be a
matter of no consequence compared to the work in hand.&nbsp; So
the <i>Bulletin</i> became Republican; Messrs. Cummings and
Peacock seeing that that was their manifest destiny.</p>
<p>From that day terrible events began to manifest themselves in
American politics.&nbsp; The South attempted to seize Kansas with
the aid of border ruffians; Sumner was caned from behind while
seated; the Southern press became outrageous in its abuse of the
North, and the North here and there retaliated.&nbsp; All my
long-suppressed ardent Abolition spirit now found vent, and for a
time I was allowed to write as I pleased.&nbsp; A Richmond editor
paid me the compliment of saying that the articles in the
<i>Bulletin</i> were the bitterest and cleverest published in the
North, but inquired if it was wise to manifest such
feeling.&nbsp; I, who felt that the great strife was imminent,
thought it was.&nbsp; Mr. Cummings thought differently, and I was
checked.&nbsp; For years there were many who believed that the
fearfully growing cancer could be cured with rose-water; as, for
instance, Edward Everett.</p>
<p>While on the <i>Bulletin</i> I translated Heine&rsquo;s
<i>Pictures of Travel</i>.&nbsp; For it, poetry included, I was
to receive three shillings a page.&nbsp; Even this was never paid
me in full; I was obliged to take part of the money in engravings
and books, <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>and the publisher failed.&nbsp; It
passed into other hands, and many thousands of copies were sold;
from all of which I, of course, got nothing.&nbsp; I also became
editor of <i>Graham&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, which I filled
recklessly with all or any kind of literary matter as I best
could, little or nothing being allowed for contributions.&nbsp;
However, I raised the circulation from almost nothing to
17,000.&nbsp; For this I received fifty dollars (&pound;10) per
month.&nbsp; When I finally left it, the proprietors were
eighteen months in arrears due, and tried to evade payment,
though I had specified a regular settlement every month.&nbsp;
Finally they agreed to pay me in monthly instalments of fifty
dollars each, and fulfilled the engagement.</p>
<p>Talking of the South, I forget now at what time it was that
Barnum&rsquo;s Museum in Philadelphia was burned, but I shall
never forget a droll incident which it occasioned.&nbsp; Opposite
it was a hotel, and the heat was so tremendous that the paint on
the hotel was scorched, and it had begun to burn in places.&nbsp;
By the door stood a friend of mine in great distress.&nbsp; I
asked what was the matter.&nbsp; He replied that in the hotel was
a Southern lady who would not leave her trunks, in which there
were all her diamonds and other valuables, and that he could not
find a porter to bring them down.&nbsp; I was strong enough in
those days.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the number of her
room?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No. 22.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rushed
up&mdash;it was scorching hot by this time&mdash;burst into No.
22, and found a beautiful young lady in dire distress.&nbsp; I
said abruptly, &ldquo;I come from Mr. --- ---; where are your
trunks?&rdquo;&nbsp; She began to cry confusedly, &ldquo;Oh, you
can do <i>nothing</i>; they are very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the two large trunks, I at once, without a word, caught
one by each handle, dragged them after me bumping downstairs, the
lady following, to the door, where I found my friend, who had a
carriage in waiting.&nbsp; From the lady&rsquo;s subsequent
account, it appeared that I had occasioned her much more alarm
than pleasure.&nbsp; She said that all at once a great tall
gentleman burst into her room, seized her trunks without a word
of apology, and dragged them downstairs like a giant; <!-- page
231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>she was never so startled in all her life!&nbsp; It was
explained to me that, as in the South only negroes handle trunks,
the lady could not regard me exactly as a gentleman.&nbsp; She
was within a short ace of being burnt up, trunks and all, but
could not forget that she was from the &ldquo;Sa-outh,&rdquo; and
must needs show it.</p>
<p>Apropos of this occurrence, I remember something odd which
took place on the night of the same day.&nbsp; There was a
stylish drinking-place, kept by a man named Guy, in Seventh
Street.&nbsp; In the evening, when it was most crowded, there
entered a stranger, described as having been fully <i>seven</i>
feet high, and powerful in proportion, who kept very quiet, but
who, on being chaffed as the giant escaped from Barnum&rsquo;s
Museum, grew angry, and ended by clearing out the
barroom&mdash;driving thirty men before him like flies.&nbsp;
Aghast at such a tremendous feat, one who remained, asked,
&ldquo;Who in God&rsquo;s wrath are you?&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you
a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>have</i> a name,&rdquo; replied the
Berserker; &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> <span class="smcap">Charles
Leland</span>!&rdquo; saying which he vanished.</p>
<p>The next day it was all over Philadelphia that I had cleared
out John Guy&rsquo;s the night before, <i>sans merci</i>.&nbsp;
True, I am not seven feet high, but some men (like stories)
expand enormously when inflated or mad; so my denial was
attributed to sheer modesty.&nbsp; But I recognised in the
Charles Leland a mysterious cousin of mine, who was really seven
feet high, who had disappeared for many years, and of whom I have
never heard since.</p>
<p>While editing <i>Graham&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, I had one day a
space to fill.&nbsp; In a hurry I knocked off &ldquo;Hans
Breitmann&rsquo;s Barty&rdquo; (1856).&nbsp; I gave it no thought
whatever.&nbsp; Soon after, Clark republished it in the
<i>Knickerbocker</i>, saying that it was evidently by me.&nbsp; I
little dreamed that in days to come I should be asked in Egypt,
and on the blue Mediterranean, and in every country in Europe, if
I was its author.&nbsp; I wrote in those days a vast number of
such anonymous drolleries, many of them, I daresay, quite as
good, in <i>Graham&rsquo;s Magazine</i> and <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>the
<i>Weekly Bulletin</i>, &amp;c., but I took no heed of
them.&nbsp; They were probably appropriated in due time by the
authors of &ldquo;Beautiful Snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to weary of Philadelphia.&nbsp; New York was a wider
field and more congenial to me.&nbsp; Mr. Cummings had once,
during a financial crisis, appealed to my better feelings very
touchingly to let my salary be reduced.&nbsp; I let myself be
touched&mdash;in the pocket.&nbsp; Better times came, but my
salary did not rise.&nbsp; Mr. Cummings, knowing that my father
was wealthy, wanted me to put a large sum into his paper,
assuring me that it would pay me fifteen per cent.&nbsp; I asked
how that could be possible when he could only afford to pay me so
very little for such hard work.&nbsp; He chuckled, and said,
&ldquo;That is the way we make our money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I
determined to leave.</p>
<p>Mr. George Ripley and Charles A. Dana, of the <i>Tribune</i>,
were then editing in New York <i>Appletons&rsquo;
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Ripley had several times shown
himself my friend; he belonged to the famous old band of Boston
Transcendentalists who were at Brook Farm.&nbsp; I wrote to him
asking if I could earn as much at the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> as
I got from the <i>Bulletin</i>.&nbsp; He answered affirmatively;
so we packed up and departed.&nbsp; I had a sister in New York
who had married a Princeton College-mate named Thorp.&nbsp; We
went to their house in Twenty-second Street near Broadway, and
arranged it so as to remain there during the winter.</p>
<p>In the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> rooms I found abundance of
work, though it was less profitable than I expected.&nbsp; For
after an article was written, it passed through the hands of six
or seven revisers, who revised not always wisely, and frequently
far too well.&nbsp; They made their objections in writing, and
we, the writers, made ours.&nbsp; I often gained a victory, but
the victory cost a great deal of work, and of time which was not
paid for.&nbsp; Altogether, I wrote about two hundred articles,
great and small, for the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.&nbsp; On the
other hand, there was pleasant and congenial society among my
fellow-workmen, <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>and the labour itself was immensely
instructive.&nbsp; If any man wishes to be well informed, let him
work on a cyclop&aelig;dia.&nbsp; As I could read several
languages, I was additionally useful at times.&nbsp; The greatest
conciseness of style is required for such work.&nbsp; In German
cyclop&aelig;dias this is carried to a fault.</p>
<p>After a while I began to find that there was much more money
to be made outside the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> than in it.&nbsp;
William H. Hurlbut, whom I had once seen so nearly shot, had been
the &ldquo;foreign editor&rdquo; of the <i>New York
Times</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Raymond, its proprietor, had engaged a
Mr. Hammond to come after some six months to take his place, and
I was asked to fill it <i>ad interim</i>.&nbsp; I did so, so much
to Mr. Raymond&rsquo;s satisfaction, that he much regretted when
I left that he had not previously engaged me.&nbsp; He was always
very kind to me.&nbsp; He said that now and then, whenever he
wanted a really superior art criticism, I should write it.&nbsp;
He was quite right, for there were not many reporters in New York
who had received such an education in &aelig;sthetics as
mine.&nbsp; When Patti made her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in opera for
the first time, I was the only writer who boldly predicted that
she would achieve the highest lyrical honours or become a
&ldquo;star&rdquo; of the first magnitude.&nbsp; Apropos of
Hurlbut, I heard many years after, in England, that a certain
well-known <i>litterateur</i>, who was not one of his admirers,
having seen him seated in close
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with a very notorious and
unpopular character, remarked regretfully, &ldquo;Just to think
that with one pistol-bullet <i>both</i> might have been
settled!&rdquo;&nbsp; Hurlbut was, even as a boy, very handsome,
with a pale face and black eyes, and extremely clever, being
<i>facile princeps</i>, the head of every class, and extensively
read.&nbsp; But there was &ldquo;a screw loose&rdquo; somewhere
in him.&nbsp; He was subject, but not very frequently, to such
fits of passion or rage, that he literally became blind while
they lasted.&nbsp; I saw him one day in one of these throw his
arms about and stamp on the ground, as if unable to behold any
one.&nbsp; I once heard a young lady in New York profess <!--
page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>unbounded admiration for him, because &ldquo;he looked
so charmingly like the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; For many years the
<i>New York Herald</i> always described him as the Reverend
Mephistopheles Hurlbut.&nbsp; There was another very beautiful
lady who afterwards died a strange and violent death, as also a
friend of mine, an editor in <i>New</i> York, both of whom
narrated to me at very great length &ldquo;a grotesque Iliad of
the wild career&rdquo; of this remarkable man.</p>
<p>It never rains but it pours.&nbsp; Frank Leslie, who had been
with me on Barnum&rsquo;s <i>Illustrated News</i>, was now
publishing half-a-dozen periodicals and newspapers, and offered
me a fair price to give him my mornings.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, my work was not specified, and he retained his old
editors, who naturally enough did not want me, although they
treated me civilly enough.&nbsp; One of these was Thomas Powell,
who had seen a great deal of all the great English writers of the
last generation.&nbsp; But there was much rather shady, shaky
Bohemianism about the frequenters of our sanctum, and, all things
considered, it was a pity that I ever entered it.</p>
<p><i>Und noch weiter</i>.&nbsp; There was published in New York
at that time (1860) an illustrated comic weekly called <i>Vanity
Fair</i>.&nbsp; There was also in the city a kind of irregular
club known as the Bohemians, who had been inspired by
Murger&rsquo;s novel of that name to imitate the life of its
heroes.&nbsp; They met every evening at a lager-beer restaurant
kept by a German named Pfaff.&nbsp; For a year or two they made a
great sensation in New York.&nbsp; Their two principal men were
Henry Clapp and Fitz-James O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; Then there were
Frank Wood and George Arnold, W. Winter, C. Gardette, and
others.&nbsp; Wood edited <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and all the rest
contributed to it.&nbsp; There was some difficulty or other
between Wood and Mr. Stephens, the <i>g&eacute;rant</i> of the
weekly, and Wood left, followed by all the clan.&nbsp; I was
called in in the emergency, and what with writing myself, and the
aid of R. H. Stoddard, T. B. Aldrich, and a few more, we made a
very creditable <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>appearance indeed.&nbsp; Little by
little the Bohemians all came back, and all went well.</p>
<p>Now I must here specify, for good reasons, that I held myself
very strictly aloof from the Bohemians, save in business
affairs.&nbsp; This was partly because I was married, and I never
saw the day in my life when to be regarded as a real Bohemian
vagabond, or shiftless person, would not have given me the
horrors.&nbsp; I would have infinitely preferred the poorest
settled employment to such life.&nbsp; I mention this because a
very brilliant and singular article entitled &ldquo;Charles G.
Leland <i>l&rsquo;ennemi des Allemands</i>&rdquo; (this title
angered me), which appeared in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
in 1871, speaks of me by implication as a frequenter of
Pfaff&rsquo;s, declaring that I there introduced Artemus Ward to
the Bohemian brotherhood, and that it was entirely due to me that
Mr. Browne was brought out before the American World.&nbsp; This
is quite incorrect.&nbsp; Mr. Browne had made a name by two or
three very popular sketches before I had ever seen him.&nbsp; But
it is very true that I aided him to write, and suggested and
encouraged the series of sketches which made him famous, as he
himself frankly and generously declared, for Charles Browne was
at heart an honest gentleman, if there ever was one; which is the
one thing in life better than success.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens realising that I needed an assistant, and
observing that Browne&rsquo;s two sketches of the Showman&rsquo;s
letter and the Mormons had made him well known, invited him to
take a place in our office.&nbsp; He was a shrewd, na&iuml;f, but
at the same time modest and unassuming young man.&nbsp; He was a
native of Maine, but familiar with the West.&nbsp; Quiet as he
seemed, in three weeks he had found out everything in New
York.&nbsp; I could illustrate this by a very extraordinary fact,
but I have not space for everything.&nbsp; I proposed to him to
continue his sketches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Write,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;a paper on the Shakers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied that he
knew nothing about them.&nbsp; I had been at Lenox,
Massachusetts, where I had often gone to New Lebanon and seen
their strange worship and dances, <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>and while
on the <i>Illustrated News</i> had had a conference with their
elders on an article on the Shakers.&nbsp; So I told him what I
knew, and he wrote it, making it a condition that I would correct
it.&nbsp; He wrote the sketch, and others.&nbsp; He was very slow
at composition, which seemed strange to me, who was accustomed to
write everything as I now do, <i>currente calamo</i> (having
written all these memoirs, so far, within a month&mdash;more or
less, and certainly very little more).&nbsp; From this came his
book.</p>
<p>When he wrote the article describing his imprisonment, there
was in it a sentence, &ldquo;Jailor, I shall die unless you bring
me something to eat!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the proof we found, &ldquo;I
shall die unless you bring me something to
<i>talk</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was just going to correct this, when
I cried, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Browne, let that
stand!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s best as it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did so,
and so the reader may find it in his work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the awful storm of war had gathered and was about to
burst.&nbsp; I may here say that there was a kind of literary
club or association of ladies and gentlemen who met once a week
of evenings in the Studio Buildings, where I had many friends,
such as Van Brunt, C. Gambrell, Hazeltine, Bierstadt, Gifford,
Church, and Mignot.&nbsp; At this club I constantly met General
Birney, the great Abolitionist, whose famous charge at Gettysburg
did so much to decide the battle.&nbsp; Constant intercourse with
him and with C. A. Dana greatly inspired me in my anti-slavery
views.&nbsp; The manager of <i>Vanity Fair</i> was very much
averse to absolutely committing the journal to Republicanism, and
I was determined on it.&nbsp; I had a delicate and very difficult
path to pursue, and I succeeded, as the publication bears
witness.&nbsp; I went several times to Mr. Dana, and availed
myself of his shrewd advice.&nbsp; Browne, too, agreed pretty
fairly with me.&nbsp; I voted for Abraham Lincoln at the first
election in New York.&nbsp; I voted <i>on principle</i>, for I
confess that every conceivable thing had been said and done to
represent him as an ignorant, ungainly, silly Western Hoosier,
and even the Republican press had <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>little or
nothing to say as to his good qualities.&nbsp; Horace Greeley had
&ldquo;sprung him&rdquo; on the Convention at the eleventh hour
and fifty-ninth minute as the only available man, and he had been
chosen as our candidate to defeat Douglas.</p>
<p>Let me here relate two anecdotes.&nbsp; When my brother heard
of Lincoln&rsquo;s &ldquo;candidacy&rdquo; he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the people shouldn&rsquo;t be
allowed to have a President for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Copperhead friend of mine, who was always aiming at
&ldquo;gentility,&rdquo; remarked to me with an air of disgust on
the same subject&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do <i>wisht</i> we could have a gentleman for
President for <i>oncet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The said Copperhead became in due time a Republican
office-holder, and is one yet.</p>
<p>Lincoln was elected.&nbsp; Then came the storm.&nbsp; Our
rejoicings were short.&nbsp; Sumter was fired on.&nbsp; Up to
that time everybody, including President Lincoln, had quite
resolved that, if the South was resolved to secede, it must be
allowed to depart in peace.&nbsp; There had been for many years a
conviction that our country was growing to be too large to hold
together.&nbsp; I always despised the contemptible idea.&nbsp; I
had been in correspondence with the Russian Iskander or Alexander
Herzen, who was a century in advance of his time.&nbsp; He was
the real abolisher of serfdom in Russia, as history will yet
prove.&nbsp; I once wrote a very long article urging the Russian
Government to throw open the Ural gold mines to foreigners, and
make every effort to annex Chinese territory and open a port on
the Pacific.&nbsp; Herzen translated it into Russian (I have a
copy of it), and circulated twenty thousand copies of it in
Russia.&nbsp; The Czar read it.&nbsp; Herzen wrote to me:
&ldquo;It will be pigeon-holed for forty years, and then perhaps
acted on.&nbsp; The Pacific will be the Mediterranean of the
future.&rdquo;&nbsp; With such ideas I did not believe in the
dismemberment of the United States. <a name="citation237"></a><a
href="#footnote237" class="citation">[237]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>But Sumter was fired on, and the whole North rose in
fury.&nbsp; It was the silliest act ever committed.&nbsp; The
South, with one-third of the votes, had two-thirds of all the
civil, military, and naval appointments, and every other new
State, and withal half of the North, ready to lick its boots, and
still was not satisfied.&nbsp; It could not go without giving us
a thrashing.&nbsp; And that was the drop too much.&nbsp; So we
fought.&nbsp; And we conquered; but <i>how</i>?&nbsp; It was all
expressed in a few words, which I heard uttered by a common man
at a <i>Bulletin</i> board, on the dreadful day when we first
read the news of the retreat at Bull Run: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hard&mdash;but we must buckle up and go at it again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is very strange that the South never understood that among the
mud-sills and toiling slaves and factory serfs of the North the
spirit which had made men enrich barren New England and colonise
the Western wilderness would make them buckle up and go at it
again boldly to the bitter end.</p>
<p>One evening I met C. A. Dana on Broadway.&nbsp; War had fairly
begun.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not less
than four years, but it may extend to seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trouble now came thick and fast.&nbsp; <i>Vanity Fair</i> was
brought to an end.&nbsp; Frank Leslie found that he no longer
required my services, and paid my due, which was far in arrears,
in his usual manner, that is, by orders on advertisers for goods
which I did not want, and for which I was charged double
prices.&nbsp; Alexander Cummings had a very ingenious method of
&ldquo;shaving&rdquo; when obliged to pay his debts.&nbsp; His
friend Simon Cameron had a bank&mdash;the Middleton&mdash;which,
if not a very wild cat, was far from tame, as its notes were
always five or ten per cent. below par, to our loss&mdash;for we
were always paid in Middleton.&nbsp; I have often known the clerk
to take a handful of notes at par and send out to buy Middleton
wherewith to pay me.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that such tricks
were universal among the very great majority of proprietors with
whom I had dealings.&nbsp; To &ldquo;do&rdquo; the
<i>employ&eacute;s</i> to the utmost was considered a matter of
course, especially when <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>the one
employed was a &ldquo;literary fellow&rdquo; of any kind or an
artist.</p>
<p>I should mention that while in New York I saw a great deal of
Bayard Taylor and his wife.&nbsp; I had known him since 1850 and
was intimate with him till his death.&nbsp; He occupied the same
house with the distinguished poet R. H. Stoddard.&nbsp; I
experienced from both much kindness.&nbsp; We had amusing
Saturday evenings there, where droll plays were improvised, and
admirable disguises made out of anything.&nbsp; In after years,
in London, Walter H. Pollock, Minto (recently deceased), and
myself, did the same.&nbsp; One night, in the latter circle, we
played <i>Hamlet</i>, but the chief character was the Sentinel,
who stared at the Ghost with such open-jawed
horror&mdash;&ldquo;<i>bouche b&eacute;ante</i>,
<i>rechignez</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;and so prominently, that poor
Hamlet was under a cloud.&nbsp; Pollock&rsquo;s great capuchon
overcoat served for all kinds of mysterious characters.&nbsp; We
were also kindly entertained many a time and oft in New York by
Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Dana.</p>
<p>My engagement expired on the <i>Times</i>&mdash;where, by the
way, I was paid in full in good money&mdash;and I found myself
without employment in a fearful financial panic.&nbsp; During the
spring and early summer we had lived at the Gramercy Park Hotel;
we now went to a very pleasant boarding-house kept by Mrs. Dunn,
on Staten Island.&nbsp; My old friend, George Ward, and G. W.
Curtis, well known in literature and politics (who had been at
Mr. Greene&rsquo;s school), lived at no great distance from
us.&nbsp; The steamboats from New York to Staten Island got to
racing, and I enjoyed it very much, but George Ward and some of
the milder sort protested against it, and it was stopped; which I
thought rather hard, for we had very little amusement in those
dismal days.&nbsp; I was once in a steamboat race when our boat
knocked away the paddle-box from the other and smashed the
wheel.&nbsp; From the days of the Romans and Norsemen down to the
present time, there was never any form of amusement discovered so
daring, so dangerous, and so exciting as a steamboat <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>race, and nobody but Americans could have ever invented
or indulged in it.</p>
<p>The old <i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i> had been for a long time
running down to absolutely nothing.&nbsp; A Mr. Gilmore purchased
it, and endeavoured to galvanise it into life.&nbsp; Its sober
grey-blue cover was changed to orange.&nbsp; Mr. Clark left it,
to my sorrow; but there was no help for it, for there was not a
penny to pay him.&nbsp; I consented to edit it for half
ownership, for I had an idea.&nbsp; This was, to make it promptly
a strong Republican monthly for the time, which was utterly
opposed to all of Mr. Clark&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>I must here remark that the financial depression in the North
at this time was terrible.&nbsp; I knew many instances in which
landlords begged it as a favour from tenants that they would
remain rent-free in their houses.&nbsp; A friend of mine, Mr.
Fales, one day took me over two houses in Fifth Avenue, of which
he had been offered his choice for $15,000 each.&nbsp; Six months
after the house sold for $150,000.&nbsp; Factories and shops were
everywhere closing, and there was a general feeling that far
deeper and more terrible disasters were coming&mdash;war in its
worst forms&mdash;national disintegration&mdash;utter ruin.&nbsp;
This spirit of despair was now debilitating everybody.&nbsp; The
Copperheads or Democrats, who were within a fraction as numerous
as the Republicans, continually hissed, &ldquo;You see to what
your nigger worship has brought the country.&nbsp; This is all
your doing.&nbsp; And the worst is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
there was soon developed a class known as Croakers, who increased
to the end of the war.&nbsp; These were good enough Union people,
but without any hope of any happy issue in anything, and who were
quite sure that everything was for the worst in this our most
unfortunate of all wretched countries.&nbsp; Now it is a law of
humanity that in all great crises, or whenever energy and
manliness is needed, pessimism is a benumbing poison, and the
strongest optimism the very <i>elixir vit&aelig;</i>
itself.&nbsp; And by a marvellously strange inspiration (though
it was founded on cool, far-sighted calculation), <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>I,
at this most critical and depressing time, rose to extremest hope
and confidence, rejoicing that the great crisis had at length
come, and feeling to my very depths of conviction that, as we
were sublimely in the right, we must conquer, and that the dread
portal once passed we should find ourselves in the fairy palace
of prosperity and freedom.&nbsp; But that I was absolutely for a
time alone amid all men round me in this intense hope and
confidence, may be read as clearly as can be in what I and others
published in those days, for all of this was recorded in
type.</p>
<p>Bayard Taylor had been down to the front, and remarked
carelessly to me one day that when he found that there was
already a discount of 40 per cent. on Confederate notes, he was
sure that the South would yield in the end.&nbsp; This made me
think very deeply.&nbsp; There was no reason, if we could keep
the Copperheads subdued, why we should not hold our own on our
own territory.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, as the war went on we
should soon win converts.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, that the North
had immense resources&mdash;its hay crop alone was worth more
than all the cotton crop of the South.&nbsp; And <i>fourthly</i>,
that when manufacturing and contract-making for the army should
once begin, there would be such a spreading or wasting of money
and making fortunes as the world never witnessed, and that while
we grew rich, the South, without commerce or manufactures, must
grow poor.</p>
<p>I felt as if inspired, and I wrote an article entitled,
&ldquo;Woe to the South.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this time, &ldquo;Woe to
the North&rdquo; was the fear in every heart.&nbsp; I showed
clearly that if we would only keep up our hearts, that the utter
ruin of the South was inevitable, while that for us there was
close at hand such a period of prosperity as no one ever dreamt
of&mdash;that every factory would soon double its buildings, and
prices rise beyond all precedent.&nbsp; I followed this article
by others, all in a wild, enthusiastic style of triumph.&nbsp;
People thought I was mad, and the <i>New York Times</i> compared
my utterances to the outpourings of a fanatical Puritan in the
time of Cromwell.</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>But they were fulfilled to the letter.&nbsp; There is
no instance that I know of in which any man ever prophesied so
directly in the face of public opinion and had his predictions so
accurately fulfilled.&nbsp; I was <i>all alone</i> in my
opinions.&nbsp; At all times a feeling as of awe at myself comes
over me when I think of what I published.&nbsp; For, with the
exception of Gilmore, who had a kind of vague idea that he kept a
prophet&mdash;as Moses the tailor kept a poet&mdash;not a soul of
my acquaintance believed in all this.</p>
<p>Then I went a step further.&nbsp; I found that the real block
in the way of Northern union was the disgust which had gathered
round the mere <i>name</i> of Abolitionist.&nbsp; It became very
apparent that freeing the slaves would, as General Birney once
said to me, be knocking out the bottom of the basket.&nbsp; And
people wanted to abolitionise without being
&ldquo;Abolitionists&rdquo;; and at this time even the <i>New
York Tribune</i> became afraid to advocate anti-slavery, and the
greatest fanatics were dumb with fear.</p>
<p>Then I made a new departure.&nbsp; I advocated emancipation of
the slaves <i>as a war measure only</i>, and my cry was
&ldquo;Emancipation for the sake of the White Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
urged prompt and vigorous action without any regard to
philanthropy.&nbsp; As publishing such views in the
<i>Knickerbocker</i> was like pouring the wildest of new wine
into the weakest of old bottles, Gilmore resolved to establish at
once in Boston a political monthly magazine to be called the
<i>Continental</i>, to be devoted to this view of the
situation.&nbsp; It was the only political magazine devoted to
the Republican cause published during the war.&nbsp; That it
fully succeeded in rapidly attracting to the Union party a vast
number of those who had held aloof owing to their antipathy to
the mere word abolition, is positively true, and still remembered
by many. <a name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242"
class="citation">[242]</a>&nbsp; Very speedily <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>indeed
people at large caught at the idea.&nbsp; I remember the very
first time when one evening I heard Governor Andrews say of a
certain politician that he was not an Abolitionist but an
<i>Emancipationist</i>; and it was subsequently declared by my
friends in Boston, and that often, that the very bold course
taken by the <i>Continental Magazine</i>, and the creation by it
of the Emancipationist wing, had hastened by several months the
emancipation of the slaves by Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; It was for
this alone that the University of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
afterwards, through its president, gave me the degree of A. M.,
&ldquo;for literary services rendered to the country during the
war,&rdquo; which is as complete a proof of what I assert as
could be imagined, for this was in very truth the one sole
literary service which I performed at that time, and there were
many of my great literary friends who declared their belief in,
and sympathy with, the services which I rendered to the
cause.&nbsp; But I will now cite some facts which fully and
further confirm what I have said.</p>
<p>The <i>Continental Magazine</i> was, as I may say, a something
more than semi-official organ.&nbsp; Mr. Seward contributed to it
two anonymous articles, or rather their substance, which were
written out and forwarded to me by Oakey Hall, Esq., of New
York.&nbsp; We received from the Cabinet at Washington continual
suggestions, for it was well understood that the
<i>Continental</i> was read by all influential Republicans.&nbsp;
A contributor had sent us a very important article indeed,
pointing out that there was all through the South, from the
Mississippi to the sea, a line of mountainous country in which
there were few or no slaves, and very little attachment to the
Confederacy.&nbsp; This article, which was extensively
republished, attracted great attention.&nbsp; It gave great
strength and encouragement <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>to the
grand plan of the campaign, afterwards realised by Sherman.&nbsp;
By <i>official request</i>, to me directed, the author
contributed a second article on the subject.&nbsp; These articles
were extensively circulated in pamphlet form or widely copied by
the press, and created a great sensation, forming, in fact, one
of the great points made in influencing public opinion.&nbsp;
Another of the same kind, but not ours, was the famous pamphlet
by Charles Stille, of Philadelphia, &ldquo;How a Free People
Conduct a Long War,&rdquo; in which it was demonstrated that the
man who can hold out longest in a fight has the best chance,
which simple truth made, however, an incredible popular
impression.&nbsp; Gilmore and our friends succeeded, in fact, in
making the <i>Continental Magazine</i> &ldquo;respected at
court.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I kept my independence and principles,
and thundered away so fiercely for <i>immediate</i> emancipation
that I was confidentially informed that Mr. Seward once exclaimed
in a rage, &ldquo;Damn Leland and his magazine!&rdquo;&nbsp; But
as he damned me only officially and in confidence, I took it in
the Pickwickian sense.&nbsp; And at this time I realised that,
though I was not personally very much before the public, I was
doing great and good work, and, as I have said, a great many very
distinguished persons expressed to me by letter or in
conversation their appreciation of it; and some on the other side
wrote letters giving it to me <i>per contra</i>, and one of these
was Caleb Cushing.&nbsp; Cushing in Chinese means &ldquo;ancient
glory,&rdquo; but Caleb&rsquo;s renown was extinguished in those
days.</p>
<p>I may add that not only did H. W. Longfellow express to me his
sympathy for and admiration of my efforts to aid the Union cause,
but at one time or another all of my literary friends in Boston,
who perfectly understood and showed deep interest in what I was
doing.&nbsp; Which can be well believed of a city in which, above
all others in the world, everybody sincerely aims at culture and
knowledge, the first principle of which&mdash;inspired by
praiseworthy local patriotism&mdash;is to know and take pride in
what is done in Boston by its natives.</p>

<p>We went to Boston early in December, 1861, and during that
winter lived pleasantly at the Winthrop House on the <!-- page
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>Common.&nbsp; I had already many friends, and took
letters to others who became our friends.&nbsp; We were very
kindly received.&nbsp; Among those whom we knew best were Mrs.
and Mr. H. Ritchie, Mrs. and Mr. T. Perkins, Mrs. H. G. Otis,
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Ward&mdash;but I must
really stop, for there was no end to the list.&nbsp; Among my
literary friends or acquaintances, or &ldquo;people whom I have
very often met,&rdquo; were Emerson, Longfellow, Dr. O. W.
Holmes, J. R. Lowell, E. P. Whipple, Palfrey, G. Ticknor,
Agassiz, E. Everett&mdash;in a word, all that brilliant circle
which shone when Boston was at its brightest in 1862.&nbsp; I was
often invited to the celebrated Saturday dinners, where I more
than once sat by Emerson and Holmes.&nbsp; As I had been editor
of the free lance <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and was now conducting the
<i>Continental</i> with no small degree of audacity, regardless
of friend or foe, it was expected&mdash;and no wonder&mdash;that
I would be beautifully cheeky and New Yorky; and truly my
education and antecedents in America, beginning with my training
under Barnum, were not such as to inspire faith in my
modesty.&nbsp; But in the society of the Saturday Club, and in
the very <i>general</i> respect manifested in all circles in
Boston for culture or knowledge in every form&mdash;in which
respect it is certainly equalled by no city on earth&mdash;I
often forgot newspapers and politics and war, and lived again in
memory at Heidelberg and Munich, recalling literature and
art.&nbsp; I heard, a day or two after my first Saturday, that I
had passed the grand ordeal successfully, or <i>summa cum magna
laude</i>, and that Dr. Holmes, in enumerating divers good
qualities, had remarked that I was modest.&nbsp; Every stranger
coming to Boston has a verdict or judgment passed on him&mdash;he
is numbered and labelled at once&mdash;and it is really wonderful
how in a few days the whole town knows it.</p>
<p>I had met with Emerson many years before in Philadelphia,
where I had attracted his attention by remarking in Mrs. James
Rush&rsquo;s drawing-room that a vase in a room was like a bridge
in a landscape, which he recalled twenty years <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>later.&nbsp; With Dr. Holmes I had corresponded.&nbsp;
Lowell! &ldquo;that reminds me of a little story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some &ldquo;genius of
freedom&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one who takes
liberties&mdash;who collected autographs, and had not even the
politeness to send a written request.&nbsp; He forwarded to me
this printed circular:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: As I
am collecting the autographs of distinguished Americans, I would
be much obliged to you for your signature.&nbsp; Yours truly, ---
---&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I was editing <i>Vanity Fair</i> I received one of these
circulars.&nbsp; I at once wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: It
gives me great pleasure to comply with your request.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Charles G. Leland</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I called the foreman, and said, &ldquo;Mr. Chapin, please to
set this up and pull half-a-dozen proofs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
done, and I sent one to the autograph-chaser.&nbsp; He was angry,
and answered impertinently.&nbsp; Others I sent to Holmes and
Lowell.&nbsp; The latter thought that the applicant was a great
fool not to understand that such a printed document was far more
of a curiosity than a mere signature.&nbsp; I met with Chapin
afterwards, when in the war.&nbsp; He had with him a small
company of printers, all of whom had set up my copy many a
time.&nbsp; Printers are always polite men.&nbsp; They all called
on me, and having no cards, left cigars, which were quite as
acceptable at that time of tobacco-famine.</p>
<p>Amid all the horrors and anxieties of that dreadful year,
while my old school-mate, General George B. McClellan, was
delaying and demanding more men&mdash;<i>mas y mas y
mas</i>&mdash;I still had as many happy hours as had ever come
into any year of my life.&nbsp; If I made no money, and had to
wear my old gloves (I had fortunately a good stock gathered from
one of Frank Leslie&rsquo;s debtors), and had to sail rather
close to the wind, I still found the sailing very pleasant, and
the wind fair and cool, though I was <i>pauper in
&aelig;re</i>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis held a ladies&rsquo; sewing-circle to
make garments for the soldiers, at which my wife worked
zealously.&nbsp; <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>There were many social receptions,
readings, etc., where we met everybody.&nbsp; It was very
properly considered bad form in those early days of the war to
dance or give grand dinners or great &ldquo;parties.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was, in fact, hardly decent for a man to dress up and appear
as a swell at all anywhere.&nbsp; Death was beginning to strike
fast into families through siege and battle, and crape to blacken
the door-bells.&nbsp; There was a dark shadow over every
life.&nbsp; I had been assured by an officer that my magazine was
doing the work of two regiments, yet I was tormented with the
feeling that I ought to be in the war, as my grandfather would
surely have been at my age.&nbsp; The officer alluded to wrote to
me that he on one occasion had read one of my articles by
camp-fire to his regiment, who gave at the end three tremendous
cheers, which were replied to by the enemy, who were not far
away, with shouts of defiance.&nbsp; As for minor incidents of
the war-time, I could fill a book with them.&nbsp; One day a
young gentleman, a perfect stranger, came to my office, as many
did, and asked for advice.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Where I live in
the country we have raised a regiment, and they want me to be
colonel, but I have no knowledge whatever of military
matters.&nbsp; What shall I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at him, and
saw that he &ldquo;had it in him,&rdquo; and replied, &ldquo;New
York is full of Hungarian and German military adventurers seeking
employment.&nbsp; Get one, and let him teach you and the men; but
take good care that he does not supplant you.&nbsp; Let that be
understood.&rdquo;&nbsp; After some months he returned in full
uniform to thank me.&nbsp; He had got his man, had fought in the
field&mdash;all had gone well.</p>
<p>I remember, as an incident worth noting, that one evening
while visiting Jas. R. Lowell at his house in Cambridge, awaiting
supper, there came a great bundle of proofs.&nbsp; They were the
second series of the Biglow Papers adapted to the new struggle,
and as I was considered in Boston at that time as being in my
degree a literary political authority or one of some general
experience, he was anxious to have my opinion of them, and had
invited me for that purpose.&nbsp; He read them <!-- page
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>to
me, manifested great interest as to my opinion, and seemed to be
very much delighted or relieved when I praised them and predicted
a success.&nbsp; I do not exaggerate in this in the least; his
expression was plainly and unmistakably that of a man from whom
some doubt had been banished.</p>
<p>My brother Henry had at once entered a training-school for
officers in Philadelphia, distinguished himself as a pupil, and
gone out to the war in 1862.&nbsp; The terrible ill-luck which
attended his every effort in life overtook him speedily, and,
owing to his extreme zeal and over-work, he had a sunstroke,
which obliged him to return home.&nbsp; He was a
first-lieutenant.&nbsp; The next year he went as sergeant, and
was again invalided.&nbsp; What further befell him will appear in
the course of my narrative.</p>
<p>The <i>Continental Magazine</i> had done its work and was
evidently dying.&nbsp; I had never received a cent from it, and
it had just met the expenses of publication.&nbsp; It had done
much good and rendered great service to the Union cause.&nbsp;
Gilmore had very foolishly yielded half the ownership to Robert
J. Walker, of whom I confess I have no very agreeable
recollections.&nbsp; So it began to die.&nbsp; But I have the
best authority for declaring that, ere it died, it had advanced
the time of the Declaration of Emancipation, which was the
turning-point of the whole struggle, and all my friends in Boston
were of that opinion.&nbsp; This I can fully prove.</p>
<p>The summer of 1862 I passed in Dedham, going every day to my
office in Boston.&nbsp; We lived at the Ph&oelig;nix Hotel, and
occupied the same rooms which my father and mother had inhabited
thirty-five years before.&nbsp; We had many very kind and
hospitable friends.&nbsp; I often found time to roam about the
country, to sit by Wigwam Lake, to fish in the river Charles, and
explore the wild woods.&nbsp; I have innumerable pleasant
recollections of that summer.</p>
<p>I returned in the autumn with my wife to Philadelphia, and to
my father&rsquo;s house in Locust Street.&nbsp; The first thing
which I did was to write a pamphlet on &ldquo;Centralisation <!--
page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span><i>versus</i> States Rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; In it I set
forth clearly enough the doctrine that the Constitution of the
United States could not be interpreted so as to sanction
secession, and that as the extremities or limbs grew in power, so
there should be a strengthening of the brain or greater power
bestowed on the central Government.&nbsp; I also advocated the
idea of a far greater protection of general and common industries
and interests being adopted by the Government.</p>
<p>There was in the Senate a truly great man, of German
extraction, named Gottlieb Orth, from Indiana.&nbsp; He was
absolutely the founder of the Bureaus of Education, &amp;c.,
which are now nourishing in Washington.&nbsp; He wrote to me
saying that he had got the idea of Industrial bureaus from my
pamphlet.&nbsp; In this pamphlet I had opposed the commonly
expressed opinion that we must do nothing to &ldquo;aggravate the
South.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, we should burn the powder up by
degrees, as the old lady did who was blown to pieces by the
experiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not drive them to
extremes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I declared that the South would go to
extremes in any case, and that we had better anticipate it.&nbsp;
This brought forth strange fruit in after years, long after the
war.</p>
<p>While I was in Boston in 1862, I published by Putnam in New
York a book entitled &ldquo;Sunshine in Thought,&rdquo; which
had, however, been written long before.&nbsp; It was all directed
against the namby-pamby pessimism, &ldquo;lost Edens and buried
Lenores,&rdquo; and similar weak rubbish, which had then begun to
manifest itself in literature, and which I foresaw was in future
to become a great curse, as it has indeed done.&nbsp; Only five
hundred copies of it were printed.</p>
<p>I was very busy during the first six months of 1863.&nbsp; I
wrote a work entitled &ldquo;The Art of Conversation, or Hints
for Self-Education,&rdquo; which was at once accepted and
published by Carleton, of New York.&nbsp; It had, I am assured, a
very large sale indeed.&nbsp; I also wrote and illustrated, with
the aid of my brother, a very eccentric pamphlet, &ldquo;The Book
of Copperheads.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Abraham Lincoln died two books
<!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>were found in his desk.&nbsp; One was the
&ldquo;Letters of Petroleum V. Nasby,&rdquo; by Dr. R. Locke, and
my &ldquo;Book of Copperheads,&rdquo; which latter was sent to me
to see <i>and return</i>.&nbsp; It was much thumbed, showing that
it had been thoroughly read by Father Abraham.</p>
<p>I also translated Heine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of
Songs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of these had already been published in
the &ldquo;Pictures of Travel.&rdquo;&nbsp; I restored them to
their original metres.&nbsp; I also translated the &ldquo;Memoirs
of a Good-for-Nothing&rdquo; from the German, and finished up,
partially illustrated, and published two juvenile works.&nbsp;
One of these was &ldquo;Mother Pitcher,&rdquo; a collection of
original nursery rhymes for children, which I had written many
years before expressly for my youngest sister, Emily, now Mrs.
John Harrison of Philadelphia.&nbsp; In this work occurs my
original poem of &ldquo;Ping-Wing the Pieman&rsquo;s
Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this Poem <i>Punch</i> said, many years
after, that it was &ldquo;the best thing of the kind which had
ever crossed the Atlantic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ping-Wing appeared in
1891 as a full-page cartoon by Tenniel in <i>Punch</i>, and as
burning up the Treaty.&nbsp; I may venture to say that
Ping-Wing&mdash;once improvised to amuse dear little
Emily&mdash;has become almost as well known in American nurseries
as &ldquo;Little Boy Blue,&rdquo; at any rate his is a popular
type, and when Mrs. Vanderbilt gave her famous masked ball in New
York, there was in the Children&rsquo;s Quadrille a little
Ping-Wing.&nbsp; Ping travelled far and wide, for in after years
I put him into Pidgin-English, and gave him a place in the
&ldquo;Pidgin-English Ballads,&rdquo; which have always been read
in Canton, I daresay by many a heathen Chinese learning that
childlike tongue.&nbsp; I also translated the German
&ldquo;Mother Goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now terrible times came on, followed, for me, by a sad
event.&nbsp; The rebels, led by General Lee, had penetrated into
Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia was threatened.&nbsp; This period
was called the &ldquo;Emergency.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could easily have
got a command as officer.&nbsp; I had already obtained for my
brother an appointment as major with secretary&rsquo;s duty on
Fremont&rsquo;s staff, which he promptly declined.&nbsp; But it
was no <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>time to stand on dignity, and I was
rather proud, as was my brother, to go as &ldquo;full
private&rdquo; in an artillery company known as &ldquo;Chapman
Biddle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; though he did not take command of it on
this occasion. <a name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a>&nbsp; Our captain was a dealer in
cutlery named Landis.</p>
<p>After some days&rsquo; delay we were marched forth.&nbsp; Even
during those few days, while going about town in my
private&rsquo;s uniform, I realised in a droll new way what it
was to be a <i>common</i> man.&nbsp; Maid-servants greeted me
like a friend, other soldiers and the humbler class talked
familiarly to me.&nbsp; I had, however, no excuse to think myself
any better than my comrades, for among the hundred were nearly
twenty lawyers or law-students, and all were gentlemen as regards
position in society.&nbsp; Among them was R. W. Gilder, now the
editor of the <i>Century</i>, who was quite a youth then, and in
whose appearance there was something which deeply interested
me.&nbsp; I certainly have a strange Gypsy faculty for divining
character, and I divined a genius in him.&nbsp; He was very brave
and uncomplaining in suffering, but also very sensitive and
emotional.&nbsp; Once it happened, at a time when we were all
nearly starved to death and worn out with want of sleep and
fatigue, that I by some chance got a loaf of bread and some
molasses.&nbsp; I cut it into twelve slices and sweetened them,
intending to give one to every man of our gun.&nbsp; But I could
only find eleven, and, remembering Gilder, went about a long mile
to find him; and when I gave it to him he was so touched that the
tears came into his fine dark eyes.&nbsp; Trivial as the incident
was, it moved me.&nbsp; Another was Theodore Fassitt, a next-door
neighbour of mine, whose mother had specially commended him to
me, and who told me that once <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>or twice he
had stolen ears of maize from the horses to keep himself
alive.&nbsp; Also Edward Penington, and James Biddle, a gentleman
of sixty; but I really cannot give the roll-call.&nbsp; However,
they all showed themselves to be gallant gentlemen and true ere
they returned home.&nbsp; The first night we slept in a railroad
station, packed like sardines, and I lay directly across a
rail.&nbsp; Then we were in camp near Harrisburg for a
week&mdash;<i>dans la pluie et la mis&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>We knew that the rebels were within six miles of us, at
Shooter&rsquo;s Hill&mdash;in fact, two of our guns went
there.&nbsp; Penington was with them, and had a small skirmish,
wherein two of the foemen were slain, the corporal being,
however, called off before he could secure their scalps.&nbsp;
That afternoon, as I was on guard, I saw far down below a few men
who appeared to be scouting very cautiously, and hiding as they
did so.&nbsp; They seemed mere specks, but I was sure they were
rebels.&nbsp; I called on Lieutenant Perkins, who had a glass,
but neither he nor others present thought they were of the
enemy.&nbsp; Long after, this incident had a droll sequel.</p>
<p>Hearing that the rebels were threatening Carlisle, we were
sent thither on a forced march of sixteen miles.&nbsp; They had
been before us, and partially burned the barracks.&nbsp; We
rested in the town.&nbsp; There was a large open space, for all
the world like a stage.&nbsp; Ladies and others brought us
refreshments; the scene became theatrical indeed.&nbsp; The
soldiers, wearied with a long march, were resting or gossipping,
when all at once&mdash;<i>whizz-bang</i>&mdash;a shell came
flying over our heads and burst.&nbsp; There were cries&mdash;the
ladies fled like frightened wild-fowl!&nbsp; The operatic effect
was complete!</p>
<p>About ten thousand rebel regulars, hearing that we had
occupied Carlisle, had returned, and if they had known that there
were only two or three thousand raw recruits, they might have
captured us all.&nbsp; From this fate we were saved by a good
strong tremendous lie, well and bravely told.&nbsp; There was a
somewhat ungainly, innocent, rustic-looking youth in our company,
from whose eyes simple truth peeped <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>out like
two country girls at two Sunday-school windows.&nbsp; He, having
been sent to the barracks to get some fodder, with strict
injunction to return immediately, of course lay down at once in
the hay and had a good long nap.&nbsp; The rebels came and roused
him out, but promised to let him go free on condition that he
would tell the sacred truth as to how many of us Federal troops
were in Carlisle.&nbsp; And he, moved by sympathy for his kind
captors, and swearing by the Great Copperhead Serpent, begged
them to fly for their lives; &ldquo;for twenty regiments of
regulars, and Heaven only knew how many, volunteers, had come in
that afternoon, and the whole North was rising, and trains
running, and fresh levies pouring in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rebels believed him, but they would not depart without
giving us a touch of their quality, and so fired shell and grape
in on us till two in the morning.&nbsp; There were two regiments
of &ldquo;common fellows,&rdquo; or valiant city roughs, with us,
who all hid themselves in terror wherever they could.&nbsp; But
our company, though unable to fire more than a few shots, were
kept under fire, and, being all gentlemen, not a man
flinched.</p>
<p>I did not, to tell the truth, like our captain; but whatever
his faults were, and he had some, cowardice was not among
them.&nbsp; Some men are reckless of danger; he seemed to be
absolutely insensible to it, as I more than once observed, to my
great admiration.&nbsp; He was but a few feet from me, giving
orders to a private, when a shell burst immediately over or
almost between them.&nbsp; Neither was hurt, but the young man
naturally shied, when Landis gruffly cried, &ldquo;Never mind the
shells, sir; they&rsquo;ll not hurt you till they hit
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was leaning against a lamp-post when a charge of grape went
through the lamp.&nbsp; Remembering the story in &ldquo;Peter
Simple,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;lightning never strikes twice in
the same place,&rdquo; I remained quiet, when there came at once
another, smashing what was left of the glass about two feet above
my head.</p>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>Long after the war, when I was one day walking with
Theodore Fassitt, I told him the tale of how I had awakened the
family at the fire in Munich.&nbsp; And Theodore dolefully
exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why it is that <i>I</i> can
never do anything heroic or fine like that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I
said, &ldquo;Theodore, I will tell you a story.&nbsp; Once upon a
time there was a boy only eighteen years of age, and it happened
in the war that he was in a town, and the rebels shelled
it.&nbsp; Now this boy had charge of four horses, and the general
had told him to stay in one place, before a church; and he
obeyed.&nbsp; The shells came thick and fast&mdash;I saw it all
myself&mdash;and by-and-bye one came and took off a leg from one
of the horses.&nbsp; Then he was in a bad way with his horses,
but he stayed.&nbsp; After a while the general came along, and
asked him &lsquo;why the devil he was stopping
there.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he replied, &lsquo;I was ordered to,
sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the general told him to get behind the
church at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; cried Theodore in amazement, &ldquo;<i>I
was that boy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and the famous Roman
sentinel who remained at his post in Pompeii was no braver, and I
don&rsquo;t think he had so hard a time of it as you had with
that horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was put on guard.&nbsp; The others departed or lay down to
sleep on the ground.&nbsp; The fire slackened, and only now and
then a shell came with its diabolical scream like a dragon into
the town.&nbsp; All at last was quiet, when there came shambling
to me an odd figure.&nbsp; There had been some slight attempt by
him to look like a soldier&mdash;he had a <i>feather</i> in his
hat&mdash;but he carried his rifle as if after deer or raccoons,
and as if he were used to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Cap!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;kin you tell me
where a chap could get some ammynition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your quartermaster,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t got no quartermaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then to your commanding officer&mdash;to your
regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t got no commanding officer
nowher&rsquo; this side o&rsquo; God, nor no regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who the devil are you, and where do you
belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t belong nowher&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll jest
tell you, Cap, how it is.&nbsp; I live in the south line of New
York State, and when I heard that the rebs had got inter
Pennsylvany, forty of us held a meetin&rsquo; and &rsquo;pinted
me Cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; So we came down here cross country, and
&rsquo;rived this a&rsquo;ternoon, and findin&rsquo;
fightin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on, went straight for the bush.&nbsp;
And gettin&rsquo; cover, we shot the darndest sight of rebels you
ever <i>did</i> see.&nbsp; And now all our ammynition is
expended, I&rsquo;ve come to town for more, for ther&rsquo;s some
of &rsquo;em still left&mdash;who want killin&rsquo;
badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my friend,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know it, but you&rsquo;re nothing but a bushwhacker,
and anybody has a right to hang or shoot you out of hand.&nbsp;
Do you see that great square tent?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here I pointed to
the general&rsquo;s marquee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go in there and report
yourself and get enrolled.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the last I saw of him
he was stumbling over the sticks in the right direction.&nbsp;
This was my first experience of a real <i>guerillo</i>&mdash;a
character with whom I was destined to make further experience in
after days.</p>
<p>An earlier incident was to me extremely curious.&nbsp; There
was in our battery a young gentleman named Stewart Patterson,
noted for his agreeable, refined manners.&nbsp; He was the gunner
of our cannon No. Two.&nbsp; We had brass Napoleons.&nbsp; At the
distance of about one mile the rebels were shelling us.&nbsp;
Patterson brought <i>his</i> gun to bear on theirs, and the two
exchanged shots at the same instant.&nbsp; Out of the smoke
surrounding Patterson&rsquo;s gun I saw a sword-blade fly perhaps
thirty feet, and then himself borne by two or three men, blood
flowing profusely.&nbsp; The four fingers of his right hand had
been cut away clean by a piece of shell.</p>
<p>At the instant I saw the blade flash in its flight, I recalled
seeing precisely the same thing long before in Heidelberg.&nbsp;
There was a famous duellist who had fought sixty or seventy times
and never received a scratch.&nbsp; One day he was acting <!--
page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>as <i>second</i>, when the blade of his principal,
becoming broken at the hilt by a violent blow, flew across the
room, rebounded, and cut the second&rsquo;s lip entirely
open.&nbsp; It was remarkable that I should twice in my life have
seen such a thing, in both instances accompanied by wounds.&nbsp;
Long after I met Patterson in Philadelphia, I think, in
1883.&nbsp; He did not recognise me, and gave me his left
hand.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Not that hand, Patterson, but the
other.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no reason to be ashamed of it.&nbsp; I
saw the fingers shot off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on that night there occurred an event which, in the end,
after years of suffering, caused the deepest sorrow of my
life.&nbsp; As we were not firing, I and the rest of the men of
the gun were lying on the ground to escape the shells, but my
brother, who was nothing if not soldierly and punctilious, stood
upright in his place just beside me.&nbsp; There came a shell
which burst immediately, and very closely over our heads, and a
piece of it struck my brother exactly on the brass buckle in his
belt on the spine.&nbsp; The blow was so severe that the buckle
was bent in two.&nbsp; It cut through his coat and shirt, and
inflicted a slight wound two inches in length.&nbsp; But the blow
on the spine had produced a concussion or disorganisation of the
brain, which proved, after years of suffering, the cause of his
death.&nbsp; At first he was quite senseless, but as he came to,
and I asked him anxiously if he was hurt, he replied sternly,
&ldquo;Go back immediately to your place by the gun!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was like grandfather Leland.</p>
<p>A day or two after, while we were on a forced march to
intercept a party of rebels, the effect of the wound on my
brother&rsquo;s brain manifested itself in a terrible
hallucination.&nbsp; He had become very gloomy and
reserved.&nbsp; Taking me aside, he informed me that as he had a
few days before entered a country-house, contrary to an order
issued, to buy food, he was sure that Captain Landis meant as
soon as possible to have him shot, but that he intended, the
instant he saw any sign of this, at once to attack and kill the
captain!&nbsp; Knowing his absolute determined and inflexibly
truthful character, <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>and seeing a fearful expression in
his eyes, I was much alarmed.&nbsp; Reflecting in the first place
that he was half-starved, I got him a meal.&nbsp; I had brought
from Philadelphia two pounds of dried beef, and this, carefully
hoarded, had eked out many a piece of bread for a meal.&nbsp; I
begged some bread, gave my brother some beef with it, and I think
succeeded in getting him some coffee.&nbsp; Then I went to
Lieutenant Perkins&mdash;a very good man&mdash;and begged leave
to take my brother&rsquo;s guard and to let him sleep.&nbsp; He
consented, and my brother gradually came to his mind, or at least
to a better one.&nbsp; But he was never the same person
afterwards, his brain having been permanently affected, and he
died in consequence five years after.</p>
<p>I may note as characteristic of my brother, that, twelve years
after his death, Walt Whitman, who always gravely spoke the exact
truth, told me that there was one year of his life during which
he had received no encouragement as a poet, and so much ridicule
that he was in utter despondency.&nbsp; At that time he received
from Henry, who was unknown to him, a cheering letter, full of
admiration, which had a great effect on him, and inspired him to
renewed effort.&nbsp; He sent my brother a copy of the first
edition of his &ldquo;Leaves of Grass,&rdquo; with his autograph,
which I still possess.&nbsp; I knew nothing of this till Whitman
told me of it.&nbsp; The poet declared to me very explicitly that
he had been much influenced by my brother&rsquo;s letter, which
was like a single star in a dark night of despair, and I have
indeed no doubt that the world owes more to it than will ever be
made known.</p>
<p>During the same week in which this occurred my wife&rsquo;s
only brother, Rodney Fisher, a young man, and captain in the
regular cavalry, met with a remarkably heroic death at Aldie,
Virginia.&nbsp; He was leading what was described as &ldquo;the
most magnificent and dashing charge of the whole campaign,&rdquo;
when he was struck by a bullet.&nbsp; He was carried to a house,
where he died within a week.&nbsp; He was of the stock of the
Delaware Rodneys, and of the English Admiral&rsquo;s, or <!--
page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>of the best blood of the Revolution, and well worthy of
it.&nbsp; It was all in a great cause, but these deaths entered
into the soul of the survivors, and we grieve for them to this
day.</p>
<p>Our sufferings as soldiers during this Emergency were very
great.&nbsp; I heard an officer who had been through the whole
war, and through the worst of it in Virginia, declare that he had
never suffered as he did with us this summer.&nbsp; And our
unfortunate artillery company endured far more than the rest, for
while pains were taken by commanding officers of other regiments,
especially the regulars, to obtain food, our captain, either
because they had the advance on him, or because he considered
starving us as a part of the military drama, took little pains to
feed us, and indeed neglected his men very much.&nbsp; As we had
no doctor, and many of our company suffered from cholera morbus,
I, having some knowledge of medicine, succeeded in obtaining some
red pepper, a bottle of Jamaica ginger, and whisky, and so
relieved a great many patients.&nbsp; One morning our captain
forbade my attending to the invalids any more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Proper medical attendance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be
provided.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not; only now and then on rare
occasions was a surgeon borrowed for a day.&nbsp; What earthly
difference it could make in discipline (where there was no show
or trace of it) whether I looked after the invalids or not was
not perceptible.&nbsp; But our commander, though brave, was
unfortunately one of those men who are also gifted with a great
deal of &ldquo;pure cussedness,&rdquo; and think that the
exhibiting it is a sign of bravery.&nbsp; Although we had no
tents, only a miserably rotten old gun-cover, and not always
that, to sleep under (I generally slept in the open air,
frequently in the rain), and often no issue of food for days, we
were strictly prohibited from foraging or entering the country
houses to buy food.&nbsp; This, which was a great absurdity, was
about the only point of military discipline strictly
enforced.</p>
<p>At one time during the war, when men were not allowed to sleep
in the country houses (to protect their owners), the <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>soldiers would very often burn these houses down, in
order that, when the family had fled, they might use the
fireplace and chimney for cooking; and so our men, forbidden to
enter the country houses to buy or beg food, stole it.</p>
<p>I can recall one very remarkable incident.&nbsp; We had six
guns, heavy old brass Napoleons.&nbsp; One afternoon we had to go
uphill&mdash;in many cases it was <i>terribly</i> steep&mdash;by
a road like those in Devonshire, resembling a ditch.&nbsp; It
rained in torrents and the water was knee-deep.&nbsp; The poor
mules had to be urged and aided in every way, and half the
pulling and pushing was done by us.&nbsp; All of us worked like
navvies.&nbsp; So we went onwards and upwards for sixteen
miles!&nbsp; When we got to the top of the hill, out of one
hundred privates, Henry, I, and four others alone remained.&nbsp;
R. W. Gilder was one of these, besides Landis and Lieutenant
Perkins&mdash;that is to say, we alone had not given out from
fatigue; but the rest soon followed.&nbsp; This exploit was long
after cited as one of the most extraordinary of the war&mdash;and
so it was.&nbsp; We were greatly complimented on it.&nbsp; Old
veterans marvelled at it.&nbsp; But what was worse, I had to lie
all night on sharp flints&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the slag or
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of an iron smeltery or old forge out of
doors&mdash;in a terrible rain, and, though tired to death, got
very little sleep; nor had we any food whatever even then or the
next day.&nbsp; Commissariat there was none, and very little at
any time.</p>
<p>From all that I learned from many intimate friends who were in
the war, I believe that we in the battery suffered to the utmost
all that men can suffer in the field, short of wounds and
death.&nbsp; Yet it is a strange thing, that had I not received
at this time most harassing and distressing news from home, and
been in constant fear as regards my brother, I should have
enjoyed all this Emergency like a picnic.&nbsp; We often marched
and camped in the valley of the Cumberland and in Maryland, in
deep valleys, by roaring torrents or &ldquo;on the mountains
high,&rdquo; in scenery untrodden by any artist or tourist, of
marvellous grandeur and beauty.&nbsp; One day we <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>came upon a scene which may be best described by the
fact that my brother and I both stopped, and both cried out at
once, &ldquo;Switzerland!&rdquo;&nbsp; The beauty of Nature was
to me a constant source of delight.&nbsp; Another was the
realisation of the sense of duty and the pleasure of war for a
noble cause.&nbsp; It was once declared by a reviewer that in my
Breitmann poems the true <i>gaudium certaminis</i>, or enjoyment
of battle, is more sincerely expressed than by any modern poet,
because there is no deliberate or conscious effort to depict it
seriously.&nbsp; And I believe that I deserved this opinion,
because the order to march, the tramp and rattle and ring of
cavalry and artillery, and the roar of cannon, always exhilarated
me; and sometimes the old days of France would recur to me.&nbsp;
One day, at some place where we were awaiting an attack and I was
on guard, General Smith, pausing, asked me something of which all
I could distinguish was &ldquo;Fire&mdash;before.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thinking he had said, &ldquo;Were you ever under fire
before?&rdquo; and much surprised at this interest in my
biography, I replied, &ldquo;Yes, General&mdash;in Paris&mdash;at
the barricades in Forty-eight.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked utterly
amazed, and inquired, &ldquo;What the devil did you think I
said?&rdquo;&nbsp; I explained, when he laughed heartily, and
told me that his question was, &ldquo;Has there been any firing
here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two very picturesque scenes occur to me.&nbsp; One was a night
before the battle of Gettysburg.&nbsp; The country was mountain
and valley, and the two opposing armies were camped pretty
generally in sight of one another.&nbsp; There was, I suppose,
nearly half a cord of wood burning for every twelve men, and
these camp-fires studded the vast landscape like countless
reflections of the stars above, or rather as if all were stars,
high or low.&nbsp; It was one of the most wonderful sights
conceivable, and I said at the time that it was as well worth
seeing as Vesuvius in eruption.</p>
<p>Henry had studied for eighteen months in the British Art
School in Rome, and passed weeks in sketching the Alhambra, and,
till he received his wound, took great joy in the picturesque
<!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>scenery and &ldquo;points&rdquo; of military
life.&nbsp; But it is incredible how little we ate or got to eat,
and how hard we worked.&nbsp; It is awful to be set to digging
ditches in a soil nine-tenths <i>stone</i>, when starving.</p>
<p>As we were raw recruits, we were not put under fire at
Gettysburg, but kept in Smith&rsquo;s reserve.&nbsp; But on the
night after the defeat, when Lee retreated in such mad and
needless haste across the Potomac, we were camped perhaps the
nearest of any troops to the improvised bridge, I think within a
mile.&nbsp; That night I was on guard, and all night long I heard
the sound of cavalry, the ring and rattle of arms, and all that
indicates an army in headlong flight.&nbsp; I say that they went
in needless haste.&nbsp; I may be quite in the wrong, but I have
always believed that Meade acted on the prudent policy of making
a bridge of gold for a retreating enemy; and I always believed,
too, that at heart he did not at all desire to inflict extreme
suffering on the foe.&nbsp; Had he been a General Birney, he
would have smote them then and there hip and thigh, and so ended
the war &ldquo;for good and all,&rdquo; like a Cromwell, with
such a slaughter as was never seen.&nbsp; I base all this on one
fact.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon before that
night I went to a farmhouse to borrow an axe wherewith to cut
some fuel; and I was told that the rebels had carried away every
axe in great haste from every house, in order to make a
bridge.&nbsp; Now, if I knew that at two o&rsquo;clock, General
Meade, if he had any scouts at all, <i>must</i> have known
it.&nbsp; But&mdash;<i>qui vult decipi</i>,
<i>decipiatur</i>.</p>
<p>That ended the Emergency.&nbsp; The next day, I think, we
received the welcome news that we were no longer needed and would
soon be sent home.&nbsp; On the way we encamped for a week at
some place, I forget where.&nbsp; There was no drill now&mdash;we
seldom had any&mdash;no special care of us, and no
&ldquo;policing&rdquo; or keeping clean.&nbsp; Symptoms of
typhoid fever soon appeared; forty of our hundred were more or
less ill.&nbsp; My brother and I knew very well that the only way
to avert this was to exercise vigorously.&nbsp; On waking in the
morning we all <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>experienced languor and
lassitude.&nbsp; Those who yielded to it fell ill.&nbsp; Henry
was always so ready to work, that once our sergeant, Mr. Bullard,
interposed and gave the duty to another, saying it was not
fair.&nbsp; I always remembered it with gratitude.&nbsp; But this
feverish languor passed away at once with a little chopping of
wood, bringing water, or cooking.</p>
<p>One more reminiscence.&nbsp; Our lieutenant, Perkins, was a
pious man, and on Sunday mornings held religious service, which
we were obliged to attend.&nbsp; One day, when we had by good
fortune rations of fresh meat, it was cooked for dinner and put
by in two large kettles.&nbsp; During the service two hungry pigs
came, and in our full sight overturned the kettles, and, after
rooting over the food, escaped with large pieces.&nbsp; I did not
care to dine, like St. Antonio, on pigs&rsquo; leavings.&nbsp; My
brother finding me, asked why I looked so glum.&nbsp; I replied
that I was hungry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo;&nbsp; We went some
distance until we came to a farmhouse in the forest.&nbsp; He
entered, and, to my amazement, was greeted as an old
friend.&nbsp; He had been there in the campaign of the previous
year.&nbsp; I was at once supplied with a meal.&nbsp; My brother
was asked to send them newspapers after his return.&nbsp; He
never sought for mysteries and despised dramatic effects, but his
life was full of them.&nbsp; Once, when in Naples, he was
accustomed to meet by chance every day, in some retired walk, a
young lady.&nbsp; They spoke, and met and met again, till they
became like friends.&nbsp; One day he saw her in a court
procession, and learned for the first time that she was a younger
daughter of the King.&nbsp; But he never met her again.</p>
<p>There were two or three boys of good family, none above
sixteen, who had sworn themselves in as of age&mdash;recruiting
officers were not particular&mdash;and who soon developed
brilliant talents for &ldquo;foraging,&rdquo; looting, guerilla
warfare, horse-stealing, pot-hunting rebels, and all those little
accomplishments which appear so naturally and pleasingly in youth
when in the field.&nbsp; For bringing out the art of taking care
of yourself, <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>a camp in time of war is superior
even to &ldquo;sleeping about in the markets,&rdquo; as
recommended by Mr. Weller.&nbsp; Other talents may be limited,
but the amount of &ldquo;devil&rdquo; which can be developed out
of a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; boy as a soldier is absolutely
infinite.&nbsp; College is a Sunday-school to it.&nbsp; One of
these youths had &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; a horse somewhere, which
he contrived to carry along.&nbsp; Many of our infantry regiments
gradually converted themselves into cavalry by this process of
&ldquo;obtaining&rdquo; steeds; and as the officers found that
their men could walk better on horses&rsquo; legs, they permitted
it.&nbsp; This promising youngster was one day seated on a
caisson or ammunition waggon full of shells, &amp;c., when it
blew up.&nbsp; By a miracle he rose in the air, fell on the
ground unhurt, and marching immediately up to the lieutenant and
touching his hat, exclaimed, &ldquo;Please, sir, caisson No. Two
is blown to hell; please appoint me to another!&rdquo;&nbsp; That
oath was not recorded.&nbsp; Poor boy! he died in the war.</p>
<p>There was one man in our corps, a good-natured, agreeable
person, a professional politician, who astonished me by the fact
that however starved we might be, he had always a flask of whisky
wherewith to treat his friends!&nbsp; Where or how he always got
it I never could divine.&nbsp; But in America every politician
always has whisky or small change wherewith to treat.&nbsp;
<i>Always</i>.&nbsp; Money was generally of little use, for there
was rarely anything to buy anywhere.&nbsp; I soon developed here
and there an Indian-like instinct in many things, and this is
indeed deep in my nature.&nbsp; I cannot explain it, but it is
<i>there</i>.&nbsp; I became expert when we approached a house at
divining, by the look of waggons or pails or hencoops, whether
there was meal or bread or a mill anywhere near.&nbsp; One day I
informed our lieutenant that a detachment of rebel cavalry had
recently passed.&nbsp; He asked me how I knew it.&nbsp; I replied
that rebel horses, being from mountainous Virginia, had higher
cocks and narrower to their shoes, and one or two more nails than
ours, which is perfectly true.&nbsp; And where did I learn
that?&nbsp; Not from anybody.&nbsp; I had <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>noticed the
difference as soon as I saw the tracks, and guessed the
cause.&nbsp; One day, in after years in England, I noticed that
in coursing, or with beagles, the track of a gypsy was exactly
like mine, or that of all Americans&mdash;that is, Indian-like
and <i>straight-forward</i>.&nbsp; I never found a
Saxon-Englishman who had this step, nor one who noticed such a
thing, which I or an Indian would observe at once.&nbsp; Once, in
Rome, Mr. Story showed me a cast of a foot, and asked me what it
was.&nbsp; I replied promptly, &ldquo;Either an Indian
girl&rsquo;s or an American young lady&rsquo;s, whose ancestors
have been two hundred years in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
the latter.&nbsp; Such feet <i>lift</i> or leap, as if raised
every time to go over entangled grass or sticks.&nbsp; Like an
Indian, I instinctively observe everybody&rsquo;s <i>ears</i>,
which are unerring indices of character.&nbsp; I can sustain, and
always could endure, incredible fasts, but for this I need coffee
in the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mark Twain&rdquo;&mdash;whom I saw
yesterday at his villa, as I correct this proof&mdash;also has
this peculiar Indian-like or American faculty of observing
innumerable little things which no European would ever think
of.&nbsp; There is, I think, a great deal of &ldquo;hard old
Injun&rdquo; in him.&nbsp; The most beautiful of his works are
the three which are invariably bound in silk or muslin.&nbsp;
They are called &ldquo;The Three Daughters, or the Misses
Clemens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to me, after I had recorded the events of our
short but truly vigorous and eventful campaign, to write to R. W.
Gilder and ask him&mdash;<i>quid memori&aelig; datum
est</i>&mdash;&ldquo;what memories he had of that great war,
wherein we starved and swore, and all but died.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are men in whose letters we are as sure to find genial
<i>life</i> as a <i>spaccio di vino</i> or wine-shop in a
Florentine street, and this poet-editor is one of them.&nbsp; And
he replied with an epistle not at all intended for type, which I
hereby print without his permission, and in defiance of all the
custom or courtesy which inspires gentlemen of the press.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Leland</span>: How your
letter carries me back!&nbsp; Do you know that one night when I
was trudging along in the dark over a road-bed where had been
scattered some loose stones to form a foundation, I heard you and
another comrade talking me over in the way to which you refer in
your letter?&nbsp; Well, it was either you or the other comrade
who said you had given me something to eat, and I know that I
must have seemed very fragile, and at times woe-begone.&nbsp; I
was possibly the youngest in the crowd.&nbsp; I was nineteen, and
really enjoyed it immensely notwithstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you in those days as a splendid expressor of
our miseries.&nbsp; You had a magnificent vocabulary, wherewith
you could eloquently and precisely describe our general condition
of starvation, mud, ill-equippedness, and over-work.&nbsp; As I
think of those days, I hear reverberating over the mountain-roads
the call, &lsquo;Cannoneers to the wheels!&rsquo; and in
imagination I plunge knee-deep into the mire and grab the spokes
of the caisson. <a name="citation266a"></a><a
href="#footnote266a" class="citation">[266a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the night we spent at the forge?&nbsp;
I burnt my knees at the fire out-doors, while in my ears was
pouring a deluge from the clouds.&nbsp; I finally gave it up, and
spent the rest of the night crouching upon the fire-bed of the
forge itself, most uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remember that we helped dig the trenches at
the fort on the southern side of the river from Harrisburg, <a
name="citation266b"></a><a href="#footnote266b"
class="citation">[266b]</a> and that one section <!-- page
267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>of
the battery got into a fight near that fort; nor can you have
forgotten when Stuart Patterson&rsquo;s hand was shot off at
Carlisle.&nbsp; As he passed me, I heard him say, &lsquo;My God,
I&rsquo;m shot!&rsquo;&nbsp; That night, after we were told to
retire out of range of the cannon, while we were lying under tree
near one of the guns, an officer called for volunteers to take
the piece out of range.&nbsp; I stood up with three others, but
seeing and hearing a shell approach, I cried out, &lsquo;Wait a
moment!&rsquo;&mdash;which checked them.&nbsp; Just then the
shell exploded within a yard of the cannon.&nbsp; If we had not
paused, some of us would surely have been hit.&nbsp; We then
rushed out, seized the cannon, and brought it out of range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, General William F. Smith (Baldy Smith) has
since told me that he asked permission to throw the militia
(including ourselves) across one of Lee&rsquo;s lines of
retreat.&nbsp; If he had been permitted to do so, I suppose you
and I would not have been in correspondence now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember undoubtedly the flag of truce that came up
into the town before the bombardment began.&nbsp; The man was on
horseback and had the conventional white flag.&nbsp; The story
was that Baldy Smith sent word &lsquo;that if they wanted the
town they could come and take it.&rsquo; <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a>&nbsp; I suppose you realise that we
were really a part of Meade&rsquo;s <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>right, and
that we helped somewhat to delay the rebel left wing.&nbsp; Do
you not remember hearing from our position at Carlisle the guns
of that great battle&mdash;the turning-point of the war? <a

<p>&ldquo;I could run on in this way, but your own memory must be
full of the subject.&nbsp; I wish that we could sometime have a
reunion of the old battery in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I have a most
distinct and pleasant remembrance of your brother&mdash;a
charming personality indeed, a handsome refined face and
dignified bearing.&nbsp; I remember being so starved as to eat
crackers that had fallen on the ground; and I devoured, too,
wheat from the fields rubbed in the hands to free it from the
ear. . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">R. W. Gilder</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I could write more, but you will not
need it from me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly, I was that other comrade whom Gilder overheard
commending him, and it was I who gave him something to eat, I
being the one in camp who looked specially after two or three of
the youngest to see that they did not starve, and who doctored
the invalids.</p>
<p>I here note, with all due diffidence, that Mr. Gilder chiefly
remembers me as &ldquo;a splendid expressor of our miseries, with
a magnificent vocabulary&rdquo; wherewith to set forth fearful
adversities.&nbsp; I have never been habitually loquacious in
life; full many deem me deeply reticent and owl-like in my
taciturnity, but I &ldquo;can hoot when the moon shines,&rdquo;
nor is there <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>altogether lacking in me in great
emergencies a certain rude kind of popular eloquence, which
has&mdash;I avow it with humility&mdash;enabled me invariably to
hold my own in verbal encounters with tinkers, gypsies, and the
like, among whom &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; is developed to a degree of
which few respectable people have any conception, and which
attains to a refinement of sarcasm, <i>originality</i>, and
humour in the London of the lower orders, for which there is no
parallel in Paris, or in any other European capital; so that even
among my earliest experiences I can remember, after an
altercation with an omnibus-driver, he applied to me the popular
remark that he was &ldquo;blessed if he didn&rsquo;t believe that
the gemman had been takin&rsquo; lessons in language hof a
cab-driver, <i>and set up o&rsquo; nights to
learn</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the ingenious American is not one
whit behind the vigorous Londoner in &ldquo;de elegant fluency of
sass,&rdquo; as darkies term it, and it moves my heart to think
that, after thirty years, and after the marvellous experiences of
men who are masters of our English tongue which the editor of the
<i>Century</i> must have had, he still retains remembrance of my
oratory!</p>
<p>At last we were marched and railroaded back to
Philadelphia.&nbsp; I need not say that we were welcome, or that
I enjoyed baths, clean clothes, and the blest sensation of
feeling decent once more.&nbsp; Everything in life seemed to be
<i>luxurious</i> as it had never been before.&nbsp; Luxuries are
very conventional.&nbsp; A copy of Pr&aelig;torius, for which I
paid only fifteen shillings, was to me lately a luxury for weeks;
so is a visit to a picture gallery.&nbsp; For years after, I had
but to think of the Emergency to realise that I was actually in
all the chief conditions of happiness.</p>
<p>Feeling that, although I was in superb health and strength,
the seeds of typhoid were in me, I left town as soon as possible,
and went with my wife, her sister, and two half-nieces, or nieces
by marriage, and child-nephew, Edward Robins, to Cape May, a
famous bathing-place by the ocean.&nbsp; One of the little girls
here alluded to, a Lizzie Robins, then six years of age, is now
well known as Elizabeth Robins Pennell, and &ldquo;a <!-- page
270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>writer of books,&rdquo; while Edward has risen in
journalism in Philadelphia.&nbsp; There as I walked often
eighteen or twenty miles a day by the sea, when the thermometer
was from 90&deg; to 100&deg; in the shade, I soon worked away all
apprehension of typhoid and developed muscle.&nbsp; One day I
overheard a man in the next bathing-house asking who I was.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but
if I were he, I&rsquo;d go in for being a
prize-fighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was poor in those days, so we went to a very cheap
though respectable hotel, where we paid less than half of what we
had always given at &ldquo;The Island,&rdquo; and where we were
in company quite as happy or comfortable as we ever had been
anywhere, though the death of her brother weighed sadly on my
poor wife, and her dear good mother, whom I always loved
tenderly, and with whom I never had a shade of difference of
opinion nor a whisper of even argument, and to whom I was always
devoted.&nbsp; I seem to have been destined to differ from other
mortals in a few things: one was, that I always loved my
mother-in-law with whole heart and soul, and never considered our
<i>m&eacute;nage</i> as perfect unless she were with us.&nbsp;
She was of very good and rather near English descent, a
Callender, and had been celebrated in her youth for extraordinary
beauty.&nbsp; Her husband was related to the celebrated beauty
Miss Vining, whom Maria Antoinette, from the fame of her
loveliness, invited to come and join her court.&nbsp; At the
beginning of this century no great foreigner travelled in America
without calling on Miss Vining in Delaware.&nbsp; There is a life
of her in Griswold&rsquo;s &ldquo;Republican Court.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is without any illustrative portrait.&nbsp; I asked Dr.
Griswold why he had none.&nbsp; He replied that none
existed.&nbsp; I said to him severely, &ldquo;Let <i>this</i> be
a lesson to you never to publish anything without submitting it
first to <i>me</i>.&nbsp; I have a photograph of her
miniature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Doctor submitted!</p>
<p>This summer at Cape May I made the acquaintance of a very
remarkable man named Solomon.&nbsp; He was a Jew, and we became
intimate.&nbsp; One evening he said to me: &ldquo;You <!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>know so much about the Jews that I have even learned
something from you about them.&nbsp; But I can teach you
something.&nbsp; Can you tell the difference between the
<i>Aschkenazim</i> and the <i>Sephardim</i> by their eyes?&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; Well, now, look!&rdquo;&nbsp; Just then a
Spanish-looking beauty from New Orleans passed by.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is Miss Inez Aguado; observe that the corners of her
eyes are long with a peculiar turn.&nbsp; Wait a minute; now,
there is Miss L&ouml;wenthal&mdash;Levi, of course&mdash;of
Frankfort.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did, and asked him to which of the classes he
belonged.&nbsp; He replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To neither.&nbsp; I am of the sect of the ancient
Sadducees, who took no part in the Crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I replied, &ldquo;You are of the
<i>Karaim</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is still another sect or division, though very
ancient indeed.&nbsp; We never held to the Halacha, and we laugh
at the Mishna and Talmud and all that.&nbsp; We do not believe or
disbelieve in a God&mdash;Yahveh, or the older Elohim.&nbsp; We
hold that every man born knows enough to do what is right; and
that is religion enough.&nbsp; After death, if he has acted up to
this, he will be all right should there be a future of
immortality; and if he hasn&rsquo;t, he will be none the worse
off for it.&nbsp; We are a very small sect.&nbsp; We call
ourselves the <i>Neu Reformirte</i>.&nbsp; We have a place of
worship in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first agnostic whom I had ever met.&nbsp; I
thought of the woman in Jerusalem who ran about with the torch to
burn up heaven and the water to extinguish hell-fire.&nbsp; Yes,
the sect was very old.&nbsp; The Sadducees never denied anything;
they only inquired as to truth.&nbsp; Seek or <i>Sikh</i>!</p>
<p>I confess that Mr. Solomon somewhat weakened the effect of his
grand free-thought philosophy by telling me in full faith of a
Rabbi in New York who was so learned in the Cabala that by virtue
of the sacred names he could recover stolen goods.&nbsp; Whether,
like Browning&rsquo;s sage, he also received <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>them, I did
not learn.&nbsp; But <i>c&rsquo;est tout comme chez nous
autres</i>.&nbsp; The same spirit which induces a man to break
out of orthodox humdrumness, induces him to love the marvellous,
the forbidden, the odd, the wild, the droll&mdash;even as I
do.&nbsp; It is not a fair saying that &ldquo;atheists are all
superstitious, which proves that a man must <i>believe</i> in
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; No; it is the spirit of nature, of
inquiry, of a desire for the new and to penetrate the unknown;
and under such influence a man may truly be an atheist as regards
what he cannot prove or reconcile with universal love and mercy,
and yet a full believer that magic and ghosts may possibly exist
among the infinite marvels and mysteries of nature.&nbsp; It is
admitted that a man may believe in God without being
superstitious; it is much truer that he may be
&ldquo;superstitious&rdquo; (whatever that means) without
believing that there is an anthropomorphic <i>bon Dieu</i>.&nbsp;
However this may be, Mr. Solomon made me reflect often and deeply
for many a long year, until I arrived to the age of Darwin.</p>
<p>I also made at Cape May the acquaintance of a very remarkable
man, whom I was destined to often meet in other lands in after
years.&nbsp; This was Carrol (not as yet General) Tevis.&nbsp; We
first met thus.&nbsp; The ladies wanted seats out on the lawn,
and there was not a chair to be had.&nbsp; He and I were seeking
in the hotel-office; all the clerks were absent, and all the
chairs removed; but there remained a solid iron sofa or settee,
six feet long, weighing about 600 pounds.&nbsp; Tevis was strong,
and a great fencer; there is a famous <i>botte</i> which he
invented, bearing his name; perhaps Walter H. Pollock knows
it.&nbsp; I gave the free-lance or <i>condottiero</i> a glance,
and proposed to prig the iron sofa and lay waste the enemy.&nbsp;
It was a deed after his Dugald Dalgetty heart, and we carried it
off and seated the ladies.</p>
<p>In the autumn there was a vast Sanitary Fair for the benefit
of the army hospitals held in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I edited for it
a daily newspaper called <i>Our Daily Fare</i>, which often kept
me at work for eighteen hours per diem, and in doing <!-- page
273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>which I was subjected to much needless annoyance and
mortification.&nbsp; At this Fair I saw Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the remarkable oil fever, or mania
for speculating in oil-lands, broke out in the United
States.&nbsp; Many persons had grown rich during the war, and
were ready to speculate.&nbsp; Its extent among all classes was
incredible.&nbsp; Perhaps the only parallel to it in history was
the Mississippi Bubble or the South Sea speculations, and these
did not collectively employ so much capital or call out so much
money as this petroleum mania.&nbsp; It had many strange social
developments, which I was destined to see in minute detail.</p>
<p>My first experience was not very pleasant.&nbsp; A publisher
in New York asked me to write him a humorous poem on the oil
mania.&nbsp; It was to be large enough to make a small
volume.&nbsp; I did so, and in my opinion wrote a good one.&nbsp;
It cost me much time and trouble.&nbsp; When it was done, the
publisher <i>refused to take it</i>, saying that it was not what
he wanted.&nbsp; So I lost my labour or <i>oleum perdidi</i>.</p>
<p>I had two young friends named Colton, who had been in the war
from the beginning to the end, and experienced its changes to the
utmost.&nbsp; Neither was over twenty-one.&nbsp; William Colton,
the elder, was a captain in the regular cavalry, and the younger,
Baldwin, was his orderly.&nbsp; It was a man in the
Captain&rsquo;s company, named Yost, who furnished the type of
Hans Breitmann as a soldier.&nbsp; The brothers told me that one
day in a march in Tennessee, not far from Murfreesboro&rsquo;,
they had found petroleum in the road, and thought it indicated
the presence of oil-springs.&nbsp; I mentioned this to Mr. Joseph
Lea, a merchant of Philadelphia.&nbsp; He was the father of Mrs.
Anna Lea Merritt, who has since become a very distinguished
artist, well known in England, being the first lady painter from
whom the British Government ever bought a picture.&nbsp; Mr. Lea
thought it might be worth some expense to investigate this
Tennessee oil.&nbsp; I volunteered to go, if my expenses were
paid, and it was agreed to.&nbsp; It is difficult at <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>the present day to give any reader a clear idea of the
dangers and trouble which this undertaking involved, and I was
fully aware beforehand what they would be.&nbsp; The place was on
the border, in the most disorganised state of society
conceivable, and, in fact, completely swarming with guerillas or
brigands, <i>sans merci</i>, who simply killed and stripped
everybody who fell into their hands.&nbsp; All over our border or
frontier there are innumerable families who have kept up feuds to
the death, or <i>vendettas</i>, in some cases for more than a
century; and now, in the absence of all civil law, these were
engaged in wreaking their old grudges without restraint, and
assuredly not sparing any stranger who came between them.</p>
<p>I had a friend in C. A. Dana, the Assistant-Secretary of War,
and another in Colonel Henry Olcott, since known as the
theosophist.&nbsp; The latter had just come from the country
which I proposed to visit.&nbsp; I asked him to aid me in getting
military passes and introductions to officers in command.&nbsp;
He promised to do so, saying that he would not go through what I
had before me for all the oil in America. <a
name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a>&nbsp; And, indeed, one could not take
up a newspaper without finding full proof that Tennessee was at
that time an <i>inferno</i> or No-man&rsquo;s Land of
disorder.</p>
<p>I went to it with my eyes wide open.&nbsp; After so many years
of work, I was as poor as ever, and the seven years of harvest
which I had prophesied had come, and I was not gathering a single
golden grain.&nbsp; My father regarded me as <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>a failure
in life, or as a literary ne&rsquo;er-do-weel, destined never to
achieve fortune or gain an <i>&eacute;tat</i>, and he was quite
right.&nbsp; My war experience had made me reckless of life, and
speculation was firing every heart.&nbsp; I bought myself a pair
of long, strong, overall boots and blanket, borrowed a revolver,
arranged money affairs with Mr. Lea, who always acted with the
greatest generosity, intelligence, and kindness, packed my
carpet-bag, and departed.&nbsp; It was midwinter, and I was
destined for a wintry region, or Venango County, where, until
within the past few months, there had been many more bears and
deer than human beings.&nbsp; For it was in Venango,
Pennsylvania, that the oil-wells were situated, and Mr. Lea
judged it advisable that I should first visit them and learn
something of the method of working, the geology of the region,
and other practical matters.</p>
<p>My brother accompanied me to the station, and I left at about
8 p.m.&nbsp; After a long, long, weary night and day, I arrived
at an oil town, whose name I now forget.&nbsp; By great good
fortune I secured a room, and by still greater luck I got
acquainted the next morning at breakfast with three or four
genial and gentlemanly men, all &ldquo;speculators&rdquo; like
myself, who had come to spy into the plumpness and oiliness of
the land.&nbsp; We hired a sleigh and went forth on an excursion
among the oil-wells.&nbsp; It was in some respects the most
remarkable day I ever spent anywhere.</p>
<p>For here was oil, oil, oil everywhere, in fountains flowing at
the rate of a dollar a second (it brought 70 cents a gallon),
derricks or scaffoldings at every turn over wells, men making
fortunes in an hour, and beggars riding on blooded horses.&nbsp;
I myself saw a man in a blue carter&rsquo;s blouse, carrying a
black snake-whip, and since breakfast, for selling a
friend&rsquo;s farm, he had received 1250,000 as commission
(<i>i.e.</i>, &pound;50,000).&nbsp; When we stopped to dine at a
tavern, there stood behind us during all the meal many
country-fellows, all trying to sell oil-lands; every one had a
great bargain at from thirty or forty thousand dollars
downwards.&nbsp; The lowest in the lot was <!-- page 276--><a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>a boy of
seventeen or eighteen, a loutish-looking youth, who looked as if
his vocation had been peddling apples and lozenges.&nbsp; He had
only a small estate to dispose of for $15,000 (&pound;3,000), but
he was very small fry indeed.&nbsp; My companions met with many
friends; all had within a few days or hours made or lost
incredible sums by gambling in oil-lands, borrowing recklessly,
and failing as recklessly.&nbsp; Companies were formed here on
the spot as easily as men get up a game of cards, and of this
within a few days I witnessed many instances.&nbsp; Two men would
meet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Got any land over?&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, not
&ldquo;stocked&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, first-rate;
geologer&rsquo;s certificate; can you put it on the
market?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve floated forty oil stocks already, terms half
profits.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it would be floated forthwith.&nbsp;
Gambling by <i>millions</i> was in the air everywhere; low common
men held sometimes <i>thirty companies</i>, all their own, in one
pocket, to be presently sprung in New York or elsewhere.&nbsp;
And in contrast to it was the utterly bleak wretchedness and
poverty of every house, and the miserable shanties, and all
around and afar the dismal, dark, pine forests covered with
snow.</p>
<p>I heard that day of a man who got a living by spiritually
intuiting oil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something told him,&rdquo; some
Socratic demon or inner impulse, that there was &ldquo;ile&rdquo;
here or there, deep under the earth.&nbsp; To pilot to this
&ldquo;ile&rdquo; of beauty he was paid high fees.&nbsp; One of
my new friends avowed his intention of at once employing this
oil-seer as over-seer.</p>
<p>We came to some stupendous tanks and to a well which, as one
of my friends said enviously and longingly, was running three
thousand dollars a day in clear greenbacks.&nbsp; Its history was
remarkable.&nbsp; For a very long time an engineer had been here,
employed by a company in boring, but bore he never so wisely, he
could get nothing.&nbsp; At last the company, tired of the
expenditure and no returns, wrote to him ordering him to cease
all further work on the next Saturday.&nbsp; But the engineer had
become &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; with the idea that he <i>must</i>
succeed, and so, unheeding orders, he bored away <!-- page
277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>all alone the next day.&nbsp; About sunset some one
going by heard a loud screaming and hurrahing.&nbsp; Hastening
up, he found the engineer almost delirious with joy, dancing like
a lunatic round a fountain of oil, which was &ldquo;as thick as a
flour-barrel, and rising to the height of a hundred
feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was speedily plugged and made
available.&nbsp; All of this occurred only a very few days before
I saw it.</p>
<p>That night I stopped at a newly-erected tavern, and, as no bed
was to be had, made up my mind to sleep in my blanket on the
muddy floor, surrounded by a crowd of noisy speculators,
waggoners, and the like.&nbsp; I tell this tale vilely, for I
omitted to say that I did the same thing the first night when I
entered the oil-country, got a bed on the second, and that this
was the third.&nbsp; But even here I made the acquaintance of a
nice Scotchman, who found out another very nice man who had a
house near by, and who, albeit not accustomed to receive guests,
said he would give us two one bed, which he did.&nbsp; However,
the covering was not abundant, and I, for all my blanket, was
a-cold.&nbsp; In the morning I found a full supply of blankets
hanging over the foot-board, but we had retired without a light,
and had not noticed them.&nbsp; Our breakfast being rather poor,
our host, with an apology, brought in a great cold mince-pie
three inches thick, which is just the thing which I love best of
all earthly food.&nbsp; That he apologised for it indicated a
very high degree of culture indeed in rural America, and, in
fact, I found that he was a well-read and modest man.</p>
<p>It was, I think, at a place called Plummer that I made the
acquaintance of two brothers named B---, who seemed to vibrate on
the summit of fortune as two golden balls might on the top of the
oil-fountain to which I referred.&nbsp; One spoke casually of
having at that instant a charter for a bank in one pocket, and
one for a railroad in the other.&nbsp; They bought and sold any
and all kinds of oil-land in any quantity, without giving it a
thought.&nbsp; While I was in their office, one man exhibited a
very handsome revolver.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>did it
cost?&rdquo; asked B.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifty dollars&rdquo;
(&pound;10).&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; replied B., &ldquo;that
when you go to Philadelphia you&rsquo;d get me a dozen of them
for presents.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man came to the window and called
for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
are the two horses I spoke about yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hardly
heeding him, and talking to others, B. went to the window, cast a
casual glance at the steeds, and said, &ldquo;What was it you
said that you wanted for them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Three thousand
dollars.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right! go and put &rsquo;em in
the stable, and come here and get the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Plummer I had to go ten miles to Oil City.&nbsp; If I had
only known it, one of my very new friends, who was very kind
indeed to a stranger, would have driven me over in his
sleigh.&nbsp; But I did not know it, and so paid a very rough
countryman ten dollars (&pound;2) to take me over on a
<i>jumper</i>.&nbsp; This is the roughest form of a sledge,
consisting of two saplings with the ends turned up, fastened by
cross-pieces.&nbsp; The snow on the road was two feet deep, and
the thermometer at zero.&nbsp; But the driver had two good
horses, and made good time.&nbsp; I found it very difficult
indeed to hold on to the vehicle and also to keep my
carpet-bag.&nbsp; Meanwhile my driver entertained me with an
account of a great misfortune which had just befallen him.&nbsp;
It was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before this here oil-fever came along I had a little
farm that cost me $150, and off that, an&rsquo; workin&rsquo; at
carpentrin&rsquo;, I got a <i>mighty</i> slim livin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I used to keep all my main savin&rsquo;s to pay taxes, and often
had to save up the cents to get a prospective drink of
whisky.&nbsp; Well, last week I sold my farm for forty thousand
dollars, and dern my skin ef the feller that bought it
didn&rsquo;t go and sell it yesterday for a hundred and fifty
thousand!&nbsp; Just like my derned bad luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my friend,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I have
travelled pretty far in my time, but I never saw a country in
which a man with forty thousand dollars was not considered
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be rich anywhere else with it,&rdquo; replied
the <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span><i>nouveau riche</i> contemptuously,
&ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t do more than buy him a glass of
whisky here in Plummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having learned what I could of oil-boring, I went to
Cincinnati, and then to Nashville by rail.&nbsp; It may give the
reader some idea of what kind of a country and life I was coming
into when I tell him that the train which preceded mine had been
stopped by the guerillas, who took from it fifty Federal soldiers
and shot them dead, stripping the other passengers; and that the
one which came after had a hundred and fifty bullets fired into
it, but had not been stopped.&nbsp; We passed by Mammoth Cave,
but at full speed, for it was held by the brigands.&nbsp; All of
which things were duly chronicled in the Northern newspapers, and
read by all at home.</p>
<p>I got to Nashville.&nbsp; It had very recently been taken by
the Federal forces under General Thomas, who had put it under
charge of General Whipple, who was, in fact, the ruling or
administrative man of the Southwest just then.&nbsp; I went to
the hotel.&nbsp; Everything was dismal and dirty&mdash;nothing
but soldiers and officers, with all the marks of the field and of
warfare visible on them&mdash;citizens invisible&mdash;everything
proclaiming a city camp in time of war&mdash;sixty thousand men
in a city of twenty thousand, more or less.&nbsp; I got a
room.&nbsp; It was so cold that night that the ice froze two
inches thick in my pitcher in my room.</p>
<p>I expected to find the brothers Colton in Nashville.&nbsp; I
went to the proper military authority, and was informed that
their regiment was down at the front in Alabama, as was also the
officer who had the authority to give them leave of
absence.&nbsp; I was also informed that my only chance was to go
to Alabama, or, in fact, into the field itself, as a
civilian!&nbsp; This was a dreary prospect.&nbsp; However, I made
up my mind to it, and was walking along the street in a very
sombre state of mind, for I was going to a country like that
described in &ldquo;Sir Grey Stele&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whiche is called the Land of
Doubte.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>And doubtful indeed, and very dismal and cold and old,
did everything seem on that winter afternoon as I, utterly alone,
went my way.&nbsp; What I wanted most of all things on earth was
a companion.&nbsp; With my brother I would have gone down to the
front and to face all chances as if it were to a picnic.</p>
<p>When ill-fortune intends to make a spring, she draws
back.&nbsp; But good fortune, God bless her! does just the
same.&nbsp; Therefore <i>si fortuna tonat</i>, <i>caveto
mergi</i>&mdash;if fortune frowns, do not for that despond.&nbsp;
Just as I was passing a very respectable-looking mansion, I saw a
sign over its office-door bearing the words: &ldquo;Captain
Joseph R. Paxton, Mustering-in and Disbursing Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph R. Paxton was a very intimate friend of mine in
Philadelphia.&nbsp; He was still a young man, and one of the most
remarkable whom I have ever known.&nbsp; He was a great
scholar.&nbsp; He was more familiar with all the <i>rariora</i>,
<i>curiosa</i>, and singular marvels of literature than any body
I ever knew except Octave Delepierre, with whose works he first
made me acquainted.&nbsp; He had translated Ik Marvel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Reveries of a Bachelor&rdquo; into French, and had been
accepted by a Paris publisher.&nbsp; He had been a lawyer, an
agent for a railroad, and had long edited in Philadelphia a
curious journal entitled <i>Bizarre</i>, and written a work on
gems.&nbsp; His whole soul, however, was in the French literature
of the eighteenth century, and he always had a library which
would make a collector&rsquo;s mouth water.&nbsp; Had he lived in
London or Paris, he would have made a great reputation.&nbsp; And
he was kind-hearted, genial, and generous to a fault.&nbsp; He
had always some unfortunate friend living on him, some Bohemian
of literature under a cloud.</p>
<p>I entered the office and found him, and great was his
amazement!&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Que diable</i>, <i>mon ami</i>,
<i>faistu ici dans cette gal&egrave;re</i>?&rdquo; was his
greeting.&nbsp; I explained the circumstances in detail.&nbsp; He
at once exclaimed, &ldquo;Come and live here with me.&nbsp;
General Whipple is my brother-in-law, and he will be <!-- page
281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>here in a few days and live with us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
make it all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, Jim!&rdquo; he cried
to a great six-foot man of colour&mdash;&ldquo;run round to the
hotel and bring this gentleman&rsquo;s luggage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There I remained for a very eventful month.&nbsp; Paxton had
entered with the conquerors, and had just seized on the
house.&nbsp; I may indeed say that <i>we</i> seized on it, as
regards any right&mdash;I being accepted as hail-fellow-well-met,
and as a bird of the same feather.&nbsp; In it was a piano and a
very good old-fashioned library.&nbsp; It was like Paxton to loot
a library.&nbsp; He had had his pick of the best houses, and took
this one, &ldquo;niggers included,&rdquo; for the servants, by
some odd freak, preferred freedom with Paxton to slavery with
their late owner.&nbsp; This gentleman was a Methodist clergyman,
and Paxton found among his papers proofs that he had been
concerned in a plot to burn Cincinnati by means of a gang of
secret incendiaries.</p>
<p>Whenever the blacks realised the fact that a Northern man was
a <i>gentleman</i>&mdash;they all have marvellous instincts for
this, and a respect for one beyond belief&mdash;they took to him
with a love like that of bees for a barrel of syrup.&nbsp; I have
experienced this so often, and in many cases so touchingly, that
I cannot refrain from recording it.&nbsp; Among others who thus
took to me was the giant Jim, who was unto Paxton and me as the
captive of our bow and spear, albeit an emancipated
contraband.&nbsp; When the Southerners defied General Butler to
touch their slaves, because they were their
&ldquo;property&rdquo; by law, the General replied by
&ldquo;confiscating&rdquo; the property by what Germans call
<i>Faustrecht</i> (or fist-right) as &ldquo;contraband of
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Jim, the general waiter and butler, was a character,
shrewd, clever, and full of dry humour.&nbsp; When I was alone in
the drawing-room of an evening, he would pile up a great
wood-fire, and, as I sat in an arm-chair, would sit or recline on
the floor by the blaze and tell me stories of his slave life,
such as this:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>&ldquo;My ole missus she always say to me, &lsquo;Jim,
don&rsquo; you ever have anything to do with dem Yankees.&nbsp;
Dey&rsquo;re all pore miserable wile wretches.&nbsp; Dey lib in
poverty an&rsquo; nastiness and don&rsquo; know
nothin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; I says to her, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
mighty quare, missus.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t understan&rsquo;
it.&nbsp; Whar do all dem books come from?&nbsp; Master gits em
from de Norf.&nbsp; Who makes all our boots an&rsquo; clothes and
sends us tea an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Dey can&rsquo;t
all be so pore an&rsquo; ignoran&rsquo; ef dey writes our books
an&rsquo; makes everythin&rsquo; we git.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jim,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a fool,
an&rsquo; don&rsquo; understan&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wery good, missus,&rsquo; says I, but I thinked it
over.&nbsp; All we do is to raise cotton, an&rsquo; dey make it
into cloff, which we hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t de sense to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe that I give this word for word.&nbsp; And Jim, as I
found, was a leading mind among the blacks.</p>
<p>I had a letter of introduction from Mr. Lea to Horace
Harrison, who was the State Attorney for Tennessee.&nbsp; At this
time his power was very great, for he had in his hands the
disposition of all the estates of all the rebels in
Tennessee.&nbsp; He was the type of a Southwestern
gentleman.&nbsp; He reminded me very much of my old Princeton
friends, and when I was in his office smoking a pipe, I felt as
if I were in college again.&nbsp; I liked him very much.&nbsp;
One morning I called, and after some deliberation he said,
&ldquo;You are a lawyer, are you not?&rdquo; I replied that I had
studied law under Judge Cadwallader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should like to consult with you as a
lawyer.&nbsp; I have a very difficult case to deal with.&nbsp;
There is a law declaring that all property belonging to rebels
shall be seized and held for one year.&nbsp; Now, here is a man
whose estate I have held for six months, who has come in and
declared his allegiance, and asks for his lands.&nbsp; And I
believe that before long, unless he comes in now, they will be
almost ruined.&nbsp; What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that if the
disposal of these lands is in your hands, you must be supposed to
exert <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>some will and discretion.&nbsp;
<i>Stat pro ratione voluntas</i> is a good axiom here.&nbsp; We
are not at all <i>in statu quo ante bellum</i>&mdash;in fact, the
war is not at an end, nor decided.&nbsp; Your duty is to act for
the good of the country, and not simply to <i>skin</i> the enemy
like a bushwhacker, but to pacify the people.&nbsp; <i>Victor
volentes per populos dat jura</i>&mdash;laws should always be
mildly interpreted.&nbsp; In your case, considering the very
critical condition of the country, I should in equity give the
man his property, and take his oath of allegiance.&nbsp; Severe
measures are not advisable&mdash;<i>quod est violentum</i>,
<i>non est durabile</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is, I believe, pretty accurately what I said.&nbsp; That
evening, as I was sitting with General Whipple, he amazed me by
addressing me exactly as Mr. Harrison had done in the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Leland, you&rsquo;re a lawyer, and I want your
advice.&nbsp; There are six warehouses here, and I want them
badly for military stores.&nbsp; But Horace Harrison says that I
can&rsquo;t have them, because he holds them for the United
States.&nbsp; What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Whipple,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is this town
under military occupation in time of war, or is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I should think from the way your patrols bother
me.&nbsp; And if such is the case, all things must yield to
military wants.&nbsp; Where we have no legal principles or courts
to decide, we must fall back on legal axioms.&nbsp; And here the
law is clear and explicit, for it says, <i>Inter arma leges
silent</i>&mdash;the laws are suspended in warfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magnificent saying!&rdquo; exclaimed the General
admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! you ought to be in the Supreme
Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; And seizing a pen he wrote to the State
Attorney:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: This town,
being but recently captured from the enemies of the United
States, is, of course, under military occupation, which renders
absolutely necessary for military purpose many temporary seizures
and uses, such as that of the six warehouses referred to in our
late correspondence.&nbsp; <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>As regards
legal precedent and principle, I need not remind one of your
learning that&mdash;(I say, Leland, how do you spell that
Latin?&mdash;<i>I-n-t-e-r</i>&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ve got
it)&mdash;<i>Inter arma silent leges</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am afraid that Horace Harrison, when he got that letter,
suspected that I had been acting as counsel for both sides.&nbsp;
However, as I took no fee, my conscience was at rest.&nbsp; I
think that I was of great use to General Whipple at that time,
and, as he said one day, an unofficial secretary.&nbsp; Great and
serious matters passed through our hands (for the General and
Harrison were taking the lead in virtually reforming the whole
frontier or debatable land), and these grand affairs were often
hurried through &ldquo;like hot cakes.&rdquo;&nbsp; My slender
legal attainments were several times in requisition on occasions
when the head of the Supreme Court would have been a more
appropriate referee.&nbsp; I discovered, however, that there was
really a department of law in which I might have done good
work.&nbsp; Questions of very serious importance were often
discussed and disposed of among us three with very great economy
of time and trouble.&nbsp; And here I may say&mdash;&ldquo;excuse
the idle word&rdquo;&mdash;that I wonder that I never in all my
life fell into even the most trifling diplomatic or civil
position, when, in the opinion of certain eminent friends, I
possess several qualifications for such a calling&mdash;that is,
quickness in mastering the legal bearings of a question, a
knowledge of languages and countries, readiness in drawing up
papers, and an insatiable love of labour, which latter I have not
found to be <i>always</i> possessed by the accomplished gentlemen
whom our country employs abroad.</p>
<p>I may here narrate a curious incident which touched and
gratified me.&nbsp; When all the slaves in Nashville were set
free by the entrance of our troops, the poor souls, to manifest
their joy, seized a church (nobody opposing), and for three weeks
held heavy worship for twenty-four hours per diem.&nbsp; <i>But
not a white soul was allowed to enter</i>&mdash;the real and
deeply-concealed reason being that Voodoo rites (which <!-- page
285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>gained great headway during the war) formed a part of
their devotion.&nbsp; However, I was informed that an exception
would be made in my case, and that I was free to enter.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; Had Jim surmised, by that marvellous intuition of
character which blacks possess, that I had in me &ldquo;the
mystery&rdquo;?&nbsp; Now, to-day I hold and possess the black
stone of the Voodoo, the possession of which of itself makes me a
grand-master and initiate or adept, and such an invitation would
seem as natural as one to a five-o&rsquo;clock tea elsewhere; but
I was not known to any one in Nashville as a
&ldquo;cunjerer,&rdquo; and the incident strikes me as very
curious.</p>
<p>Apropos of marvels, many of the blacks can produce in their
throats by some strange process sounds, and even airs, resembling
those of the harmonicon, or musical box, one or the other or
both.&nbsp; One evening in Nashville, in a lonely place, I heard
exquisite music, which I thought must be that of a superior
hand-organ from afar.&nbsp; But, to my amazement, I could
discover none; there were only two black boys in the
street.&nbsp; Alexis Paxton, the son of my host, explained to me
that what I heard was unquestionably music made by those ebony
flutes of boys, and that there were some wonderful performers in
the city.&nbsp; I have listened to the same music at a public
exhibition.&nbsp; I greatly wonder that I have never heard of
this kind of music in Europe or the East.&nbsp; It is distinctly
<i>instrumental</i>, not vocal in its tones.&nbsp; It has the
obvious recommendation of economy, since by means of it a young
lady could be performer and pianoforte all in one, which was
indeed the beginning of the invention in Syrinx, who was made
into a pan-pipe, which as a piano became the great musical curse
(according to Heine) of modern times, and by which, as I
conjecture, the fair Miss Reed or Syrinx revenges herself on male
humanity.&nbsp; By the way, the best singer of &ldquo;<i>Che faro
senza Euridice</i>&rdquo; whom I ever heard was a Miss Reed, a
sister of Mrs. Paran Stevens.</p>
<p>I had a very pleasant time with Paxton, and I know right well
that I was no burden on him, but a welcome friend.&nbsp; <!--
page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span><i>Au reste</i>, there was plenty of room in the house,
and abundant army stores to be had for asking, and one or two
rare acquaintances.&nbsp; One of these was a Southern officer,
now a general, who had come over to our side and fought, as the
saying was, with a rope round his neck.&nbsp; He was terribly
hated by the rebels, which hate he returned with red-hot double
compound interest&mdash;for a renegade is worse than ten
Turks.&nbsp; He was the very type of a grim, calm old Border
moss-trooper.&nbsp; He lived in his boots, and never had an ounce
of luggage.&nbsp; One evening General Whipple (always humane and
cultivated, though as firm as an iron bar) said to him before me,
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what to do with many of my rebel
prisoners.&nbsp; They dress themselves in Federal uniforms for
want of other clothes; they take them from the dead on the
battlefield, and try to pass themselves off for Federals.&nbsp;
It is very troublesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble to me,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot them as <i>spies</i>.&nbsp; Why, only last week I
got four dozen of them, and in less than four minutes I had them
all laid out stiff in the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader need not imagine that the general here romanced or
exaggerated.&nbsp; At that very moment the massacres and murders
which were going on within three miles of us were beyond
belief.&nbsp; The bands of <i>guerillas</i> or bushwhackers which
swept the country murdered in cold blood all who fell into their
hands, and the Confederate soldiers often did the same.&nbsp;
There resulted, of course, a deadly hatred on both sides, and the
most unscrupulous retaliation.</p>
<p>I could fill a book with the very interesting observations
which I made in Nashville.&nbsp; And here I call attention to a
very strange coincidence which this recalls.&nbsp; During the
previous year I had often expressed a great desire to be in some
State during its transition from Confederacy to Unionism, that I
might witness the remarkable social and political paradoxes and
events which would result, and I had often <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>specified
Tennessee as the one above all others which I should prefer to
visit for this purpose.&nbsp; And I had about as much idea that I
should go to the moon as there.&nbsp; But prayers are strangely
granted at strange hours&mdash;<i>plus impetravi quam fuissem
ausus</i>&mdash;and I was placed in the very centre of the
wheel.&nbsp; This very remarkable fulfilment of a wish, and many
like it, though due to mere chance, naturally made an impression
on me, for no matter how strong our eyesight may be, or our sense
of truth, we are all dazed when coming out of darkness into
light, and all the world is in that condition now.&nbsp; No
matter how completely we exchange the gloom of supernaturalism
for the sunlight of science, phantoms still seem to flit before
our eyes, and, what is more bewildering still, we do not as yet
know but what these phantoms may be physical facts.&nbsp; Perhaps
the Voodoo stone <i>may</i> have the power to awaken the faith
which may move the vital or nervous force, which may act on
hidden subtler forms of electricity and matter, atoms and
molecules.&nbsp; Ah! we have a great deal to learn!</p>
<p>Through General Whipple&rsquo;s kind aid the brothers Colton
were at once brought up from the front.&nbsp; With them and
Captain Paxton we went to Murfreesboro, and at once called on the
general in command, whose name I have forgotten.&nbsp; He struck
me as a grim, brave old commander, every inch a soldier.&nbsp;
While we conversed with him a sergeant entered, a man who looked
as if he lived in the saddle, and briefly reported that a gang of
guerillas were assembled at a certain place some miles
away&mdash;I forget how far, but the distance was traversed in an
incredibly short time.&nbsp; The general issued orders for a
hundred cavalry to go at once and &ldquo;get&rdquo; them.&nbsp;
They &ldquo;got&rdquo; them, killing many, and the next morning,
on looking from my window, I saw the victors ride into the
courtyard, many of them with their captives tied neck and heels,
like bags of corn, over the cruppers of the horses.&nbsp; A nice
night&rsquo;s ride they must have had!&nbsp; But the choice was
between death and being cruppered, and they preferred the <!--
page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>latter to coming a cropper.&nbsp; Strange that the less
a man has to live for the more he clings to life.</p>
<p>The general thought that if he gave us a corporal and four
men, and if we were well armed, that we <i>might</i> go out on
the Bole Jack road and return unharmed, &ldquo;unless we met with
any of the great gangs of bushwhackers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he
evidently thought, as did General Whipple, who did not heed a
trifle by any means, that we were going into the lion&rsquo;s
jaws.&nbsp; So the next morning, <i>equo iter ingredi</i>, I rode
forth.&nbsp; I had some time before been appointed aide-de-camp
to Governor Pollock, of Pennsylvania, with the rank of colonel,
and had now two captains and a corporal with his guard.&nbsp; It
was a rather small regiment.</p>
<p>We heard grim stories that morning as to what had taken place
all around us within almost a few hours.&nbsp; Three Federal
pickets had been treacherously shot while on guard the night
before; the troops had surprised a gang of bushwhackers holding a
ball, and firing through the windows, dropped ten of them dead
while dancing; two men had been murdered by --- --- and his
gang.&nbsp; This was a noted guerilla, who was said to have gone
south with the Confederate army, but who was more generally
believed to have remained in hiding, and to have committed most
of the worst outrages and murders of late.</p>
<p>At the first house where we stopped in the woods there lay a
wounded man, one of the victims of the dance the night
before.&nbsp; The inmates were silent, but not rude to us.&nbsp;
I offered a man whisky, but he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We rode on.&nbsp; Once there was an alarm of
&ldquo;bushwhackers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should have forgotten it but
for the memory of the look of Baldwin Colton&rsquo;s eyes, the
delighted earnestness of a man or of a wild creature going to
fight.&nbsp; He and his brother had hunted and fought guerillas a
hundred times, perhaps much oftener, for it was a regular daily
service at the front.&nbsp; Once during a retreat, Baldwin
(eighteen or nineteen years of age) fell out of rank so often to
engage in hand-to-hand sword <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>conflicts
with rebel cavalrymen, that his brother detached four to take him
prisoner and keep him safe.&nbsp; Daring spirits among our
soldiers often became very fond of this kind of duelling, in
which the rebs were not a whit behind them, and two of the
infantry on either side would, under cover of the bushes, aim and
pop away at one another perhaps for hours, like two red
Indians.</p>
<p>I have forgotten whether it was with extra whisky, coffee, or
money that we specially gratified our corporal and guard; but
Baldwin, who was &ldquo;one of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; informed me that
they enjoyed this little outing immensely, just like a picnic,
and had a good time.&nbsp; From which it may be inferred that
men&rsquo;s ideas of enjoyment are extremely relative.&nbsp; It
could not have been in the dodging of guerillas&mdash;to that
they were accustomed; perhaps it was the little extra ration, or
the mystery of the excursion, for they were much puzzled to know
what I wanted, why I examined the road and rocks, and all so
strangely, and went into the very worst place in all the land to
do so.&nbsp; Baldwin Colton himself had been so knocked about
during the war, and so starved as a prisoner in Southern hands,
that he looked back on a sojourn in that <i>ergastulum</i>, Libby
Prison, as rather an oasis in his sad experiences.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so bad a place as some, and there was good
company, and always <i>something to eat</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
optimist of Candide was a Mallock in mourning compared to
this.</p>
<p>That night we came to somebody&rsquo;s plantation.&nbsp; I
forget his name, but he was a Union man, probably a <i>very</i>
recent acquisition, but genial.&nbsp; He had read the
<i>Knickerbocker</i>, and knew my name well, and took good care
of us.&nbsp; In the morning I offered him ten dollars for our
night&rsquo;s lodging, which was, in the opinion of my two
captains, stupendously liberal, as soldiers never paid.&nbsp; Our
host declined it like a Southern planter, on the ground that he
never sold his hospitality.&nbsp; So I put the money into the
hand of one of his pretty children as a present.&nbsp; But as we
rode forth we were called back, and reminded that we had
forgotten to pay for <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>the <i>soldiers</i>!&nbsp; I gave
another five-dollar greenback and rode away disgusted.&nbsp; And
at the gate a negro girl begged us to give her a
&ldquo;dalla&rdquo; (dollar) to buy a fish-line.&nbsp; It all
came from my foolish offer to pay.&nbsp; Gratitude is a sense of
further benefits to be bestowed.</p>
<p>The place where the oil had been seen was near a conical rocky
hill called Grindstone Knob.&nbsp; We examined carefully and
found no trace of it.&nbsp; The geology of the country was
unfavourable, much flint and conglomerate, if I remember, and
wanting in the signs of coal, shales, &amp;c., and
&ldquo;faults&rdquo; or ravines.&nbsp; I may be quite wrong, but
such was my opinion.&nbsp; No one who lived thereabout had ever
heard of &ldquo;ile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once I asked a rustic if any
kind of oil was found in the neighbourhood in springs.&nbsp; His
reply was, &ldquo;What! <i>ile</i> come up outer the ground like
water!&nbsp; H---!&nbsp; I never heard of sitch a
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>There was no oil</i>.</p>
<p>At the foot of Grindstone Knob was a rather neat, small house,
white, with green blinds.&nbsp; We were somewhat astonished to
learn from a negro boy, who spoke the most astonishingly bad
English, that this was the home of Mas&rsquo; --- ---.&nbsp; Yes,
this was the den of the wolf himself, and I had no doubt that he
was not far off.&nbsp; There was a small cotton plantation round
about.</p>
<p>We entered, and were received by a good-looking, not
unladylike, but rather fierce-eyed young woman and her younger
sister.&nbsp; It was Mrs. ---.&nbsp; The two had been to a
lady&rsquo;s seminary in Nashville, and played the piano for
us.&nbsp; I felt that we were in a strange situation, and now and
then walked to the window and looked out, listening all the time
suspiciously to every sound.&nbsp; It was easy enough for Mrs.
---, the brigand&rsquo;s wife, to perceive from my untanned
complexion that I had not been in the field, and was manifestly
no soldier.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> look like an officer,&rdquo;
she said to Captain Colton, &ldquo;and so does <i>that</i> one,
but what is <i>he</i>?&rdquo; meaning me by this last.&nbsp; We
had dinner&mdash;roast kid&mdash;and when we departed I gave the
dame five dollars, having <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>the feeling
that I could not be indebted to thieves for a dinner.</p>
<p>We had gone but a little distance when we saw two bushwhackers
with guns, and gave chase, but they disappeared in the bushes,
much to the grief of our men, who would have liked either to
shoot them or to bring them in.&nbsp; Then the corporal told us
that while we were at dinner&rsquo;s &ldquo;faithful
blacks&rdquo; had informed his men that &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; had
been at home ever since Crismas&rdquo;; that at eleven
o&rsquo;clock every night they assembled at the house and thence
went out marauding and murdering.</p>
<p>I paused, astonished and angry.&nbsp; It was almost certain
that the bushwhacker had been during dinner probably in the
cellar under our feet.&nbsp; The guerillas had great fear of our
regular soldiers; two of the latter were a match at any time for
half-a-dozen of the former, as was proved continually.&nbsp;
Should I go back and hang --- up over his own door?&nbsp; I was
dying to do it, but we had before us a very long ride through the
Cedar Barrens, the sun was sinking in the west, and we had heard
news which made it extremely likely that a large band of
guerillas would be in the way.</p>
<p>That resolve to go actually saved our lives, for I heard the
next day that a hundred and fifty of these free murderers had
gone on our road just after us.&nbsp; This fact was at once
transferred to the Northern newspapers, that &ldquo;on --- a
hundred and fifty bushwhackers passed over the Bole Jack
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was read by my wife and father, who knew
that on that very day I was on that road, to their great
apprehension.</p>
<p>I never shall forget the dismal appearance of the Cedar
Barrens.&nbsp; The soil was nowhere more than two inches deep,
and the trees which covered it by millions had all died as soon
as they attained a height of fifteen or twenty feet.&nbsp; Swarms
of ill-omened turkey-buzzards were the only living creatures
visible &ldquo;like foul <i>lemur&eacute;s</i> flitting in the
gloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riding over the battlefield the Coltons and Paxton <!-- page
292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>pointed out many things, for they had all been in it
severely.&nbsp; At one place, Major Rosengarten, a brother of my
old Paris fellow-student, had had a sabre-fight with a rebel, and
they told me how Rosengarten&rsquo;s sword, being one of the kind
which was issued by contract in the earlier days of the war, bent
and broke like a piece of tin.&nbsp; Hearing a ringing sound
Baldwin jumped from his horse, picked up a steel ramrod and gave
it to me for a cane.</p>
<p>As we approached Murfreesboro&rsquo; I met a genial, daring
soldier, one Major Hill, whom I had seen before.&nbsp; He had
with him a hundred and fifty cavalry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you
going so late by night?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I am after that infernal scoundrel, ---
---.&nbsp; My scouts have found out pretty closely his
range.&nbsp; I am going to divide my men into tens and scatter
them over the country and then close in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I will tell you just
where to lay your hand at once, heavy on him.&nbsp; Do you know
Grindstone Knob and a white house with green windows at its
foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be there at exactly eleven to-night, and
you&rsquo;ll get him.&nbsp; I have been there and learned it from
the niggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare that you are a good scout, Mr.
Leland!&rdquo; cried the Major in amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
can I do to thank you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Major Hill,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have one
thing to request: that is, if you get ---, don&rsquo;t parole
him.&nbsp; <i>Shoot him at once</i>; he is a red-handed
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will</i> shoot him,&rdquo; said the Major, and
rode forth into the night with his men.&nbsp; But whether he ever
got --- I never knew, though according to the calculations of the
Coltons, who were extremely experienced in such matters,
&ldquo;Massa ---&rdquo; had not more than one chance in a
thousand to escape, and Hill was notoriously a good
guerilla-hunter and a man of his word.</p>
<p>I believe that at the plantation our men had camped out.&nbsp;
<!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>At Murfreesboro&rsquo; we returned them to the general,
and I took the Coltons to a hotel, which was so very rough that I
apologised for it, while Baldwin said it seemed to him to be
luxurious beyond belief, and that it was the first night for
eighteen months in which he had slept in a bed.&nbsp; In the
morning I wanted a spur, having lost one of mine, and there was
brought to me a large boxful of all kinds of spurs to choose
from, which had been left in the house at one time or another
during the war.</p>
<p>I did not remain long in Nashville after returning
thither.&nbsp; I had instructions to go to Louisville, Kentucky,
and there consult with a certain merchant as to certain
lands.&nbsp; General Whipple accompanied me to the
&ldquo;dep&ocirc;t,&rdquo; which was for the time and place as
much of an honour as if Her Majesty were to come to see me off at
Victoria Station.&nbsp; There was many and many a magnate in
those days and there, who would have given thousands to have had
his ear as Paxton and I had it.</p>
<p>One night we were in the side private box at the theatre in
Nashville.&nbsp; Couldock, whom I had known well many years
before, was on the stage.&nbsp; The General was keeping himself
deeply in the shade to remain unseen.&nbsp; He remarked to Paxton
that he wanted a house for his family, who would soon arrive, and
could not find one, for they were all occupied.&nbsp; This one
remark shows the man.&nbsp; I wonder how long General Butler
would have hesitated to move anybody!</p>
<p>Captain Paxton knew everything and everybody.&nbsp; With a
quick glance from his keen dark eyes he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&nbsp; Do you see that fat man
laughing so heartily in the pit?&nbsp; He has a splendid house;
it would just suit you; and he&rsquo;s a d---d old rebel.&nbsp; I
know enough about him to hang him three times over.&nbsp; He
has&rdquo; (here followed a series of political
iniquities).&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave; votre
affaire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is it that he has kept his house?&rdquo; asked
the General.</p>
<p><!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>&ldquo;He sent the quartermaster a barrel of whisky, or
something of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General looked thoughtfully at the fat man as the latter
burst into a fresh peal of laughter.&nbsp; I thought that if he
had known what was being said in our box that laugh would have
died away.</p>
<p>I do not know whether the General took the house.&nbsp; I
think he did.&nbsp; I left for Louisville.&nbsp; There I saw the
great merchant, who invited me to his home to supper and
consulted with me.&nbsp; His daughters were rebels and would not
speak to me.&nbsp; He had a great deal of property in Indiana,
which <i>might</i> be oil-lands.&nbsp; If I would visit it and
report on it, he would send his partner with me to examine
it.&nbsp; I consented to go.</p>
<p>This partner, Mr. W., was a young man of agreeable, easy
manners.&nbsp; With him I went to Indianapolis, and thence by
&ldquo;stages,&rdquo; waggons, or on horseback through a very
dismal country in gloomy winter into the interior of the
State.&nbsp; I can remember vast marshy fields with millions of
fiddler crabs scuttling over them, and more mud than I had ever
seen in my life.&nbsp; The village streets were six inches deep
in soft mud up to the doors and floors of the houses.&nbsp; At
last we reached our journey&rsquo;s end at a large log-house on a
good farm.</p>
<p>I liked the good man of the house.&nbsp; He said to us, after
a time, that at first he thought we were a couple of stuck-up
city fellows, but had found to his joy that we were
old-fashioned, sensible people.&nbsp; There was no sugar at his
supper-table, but he had three substitutes for
it&mdash;&ldquo;tree-sweetnin&rsquo;, bee-sweetnin&rsquo;, and
sorghum&rdquo;&mdash;that is, maple sugar, honey, and the
molasses made from Chinese maize.&nbsp; Only at a mile&rsquo;s
distance there was a &ldquo;sugar-camp,&rdquo; and we could see
the fires and hear the shouts of the people engaged night and day
in making sugar from the trees.</p>
<p>He told me that on the hills in sight a mysterious light often
wandered.&nbsp; During the Revolutionary war some one <!-- page
295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>had buried a barrelful of silver plate and money, and
over it flitted the quivering silver flame, but no one could ever
find the spot.</p>
<p>The next day I examined the land.&nbsp; There was abundance of
fossiliferous limestone, rich in petrifactions of tertiary
shells, also cartloads of beautiful <i>geodes</i> or round flint
balls, which often rattled, and which, when broken, were
encrusted with white or purple amethystine crystals.&nbsp; I
decided that there were places where oil might be found, though
there was certainly no indication of it.&nbsp; I believe that my
conjecture subsequently proved to be true, and that Indiana has
shown herself to be a wise virgin not without oil.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the next day, riding with my guide, I
found that I had left my blanket at a house miles behind.&nbsp; I
offered the man a large price to return and bring it, which he
did.&nbsp; While waiting by the wood, in a dismal drizzle, I saw
a log cabin and went to it for shelter.&nbsp; Its only inmate was
a young woman, who, seeing me coming, hastily locked the door and
rushed into the neighbouring woods.&nbsp; When the guide returned
I expressed some astonishment at the flight; <i>he</i> did
not.&nbsp; With a very grave expression he asked me,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t the gals in <i>your</i> part of the country
allays break for the woods when they see <i>you</i>
a-coming?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; To which he made answer, &ldquo;Thank God, our
gals here hev got better morrils than yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We returned to St. Louis.&nbsp; There I was shown the
immensely long tomb of Porter the Kentucky giant.&nbsp; This man
was nine feet in height!&nbsp; I had seen him alive long before
in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I made several interesting acquaintances
in St. Louis, the Athens of the West.&nbsp; But I must hurry
on.</p>
<p>I went to Cincinnati, where I found orders to wait for Mr.
Lea.&nbsp; A syndicate had been formed in Providence, Rhode
Island, which had purchased a great property in Cannelton, West
Virginia.&nbsp; This consisted of a mountain in which there was
an immense deposit of cannel coal.&nbsp; Cannelton was very <!--
page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>near the town of Charleston, which is at the junction
of the Kanawha (a tributary of the Ohio) and Elk rivers.</p>
<p>I waited a week at the hotel in Cincinnati for Mr. Lea.&nbsp;
It was a weary week, for I had no acquaintances and made
none.&nbsp; Never in my life before did I see so many Sardines,
or Philistines of the dullest stamp as at that hotel.&nbsp; But
at last Mr. Lea came with a party of ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp;
A small steamboat was secured, and we went up the Ohio.&nbsp; The
voyage was agreeable and not without some incidents.&nbsp; There
was a freshet in the river, and one night, taking a short cut
over a cornfield, the steamboat stuck fast&mdash;like
Eve&mdash;in an apple-tree.</p>
<p>One day one of the party asked me what was the greatest
aggregate deposit of coal known in England.&nbsp; I could not
answer.&nbsp; A few hours after we stopped at a town in
Kentucky.&nbsp; There I discovered by chance some old Patent
Office reports, and among them all the statistics describing the
coal mines in England.&nbsp; When we returned to the boat I told
my informant that the largest deposit in England was just half
that of Cannelton, and added many details.&nbsp; Mr. Lea was
amazed at my knowledge.&nbsp; I told him that I deserved no
credit, for I had picked it up by chance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and how was it that you
<i>chanced</i> to read that book?&nbsp; None of us did.&nbsp;
Such chances come to inquiring minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also chanced that this whole country abounded in signs of
petroleum.&nbsp; It was found floating on springs.&nbsp; The
company possessed rights of royalty on thousands of acres on Elk
River, which was as yet in the debatable land, harassed by
rebels.&nbsp; These claims, however, were &ldquo;run out,&rdquo;
and needed to be renewed by signatures from the residents.&nbsp;
They were in the hands of David Goshorn, who kept the only
&ldquo;tavern&rdquo; or hotel in Charleston, and he asked $5,000
for his rights.&nbsp; There was another party in the field after
them.</p>
<p>I verily believe that David Goshorn sold the right to me
because he played the fiddle and I the guitar, and because he did
not like the rival, who was a Yankee, while I was a congenial
<!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>companion.&nbsp; Many a journey had we together, and as
I appreciated him as a marked character of odd oppositions, we
got on admirably.</p>
<p>In Cannelton I went down into a coal mine and risked my life
strangely in ascending a railway.&nbsp; The hill is 1,500 feet in
height, and on its face is a railway which ascends at an angle of
15&deg;, perhaps the steepest in America.&nbsp; I ascended in it,
and soon observed that of the two strands of the iron cable which
drew it one was broken.&nbsp; The very next week the other broke,
and two men were killed by an awful death, they and the car
falling a thousand feet to the rocks below.</p>
<p>The next week we returned to Cincinnati, and thence to
Philadelphia.&nbsp; On my way from New York to Providence I
became acquainted in the train with a modest, gentlemanly man,
who told me he was a great-grandson or descendant of Thomson who
wrote the &ldquo;Seasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought him both great
and grand in an incident which soon occurred.&nbsp; A burly,
bull-necked fellow in the car was attacked with an epileptic
fit.&nbsp; He roared, kicked, screamed like a wildcat; and among
fifty men in the vehicle, I venture to say that only Thomson and
I, in a lesser degree, showed any plain common sense.&nbsp; I
darted at the epileptic, grappled with him, held him down by what
might be called brutal kindness, for I held his head down, while
I sat on his arm and throttled him <i>sans merci</i>&mdash;I avow
it&mdash;and tore off in haste his neckcloth (his neck was
frightfully swelled), while Thomson brought cold water from the
&ldquo;cooler,&rdquo; with which we bathed his face freely, and
chafed his pulse and forehead.&nbsp; Little by little he
recovered.&nbsp; The other passengers, as usual, did nothing, and
a little old naval officer, who had been fifty years in service
(as Thomson told me), simply kicked and screamed convulsively,
&ldquo;Take him away! take him away!&rdquo;&nbsp; The epileptic
was George Christy, the original founder of the Christy
Minstrels.&nbsp; I can never think of this scene without
exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Vive</i> Thomson!&rdquo; for he was the
only man among us who displayed quiet self-possession and
<i>savoir faire</i>.&nbsp; As for me, my <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>&ldquo;old
Injun&rdquo; was up, and I had &ldquo;sailed in&rdquo; for a
fight by mere impulse.&nbsp; <i>Vive</i> Thomson!&nbsp; <i>Bon
sang ne peut mentir</i>.</p>
<p>I went to Providence, where I was empowered to return to
Cannelton to pay Goshorn $5,000, and renew the leases on Elk
River.&nbsp; I should have to travel post to anticipate the
Yankee.&nbsp; It was not concealed from me that even if I
succeeded, I had before me a very dangerous and difficult
task.&nbsp; But after what I had already gone through with I was
ready for anything.&nbsp; I was really developing rapidly a wild,
reckless spirit&mdash;the &ldquo;Injun&rdquo; was coming out of
me.&nbsp; My old life and self had vanished like dreams.&nbsp;
Only now and then, in the forests or by torrents, did something
like poetry revisit me; <i>literature</i> was dead in me.&nbsp;
Only once did I, in a railway train, compose the &ldquo;Maiden
mit nodings on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I bore it in my memory for years
before I wrote it out.</p>
<p>I arrived in Philadelphia.&nbsp; The next morning I was to
rise early and fly westward.&nbsp; No time to lose.&nbsp; Before
I rose, my sister knocked at the door and told us the awful news
that President Lincoln had been murdered!</p>
<p>As I went to the station I saw men weeping in the streets, and
everybody in great grief, conversing with strangers, as if all
had lost a common relation.&nbsp; Everywhere utter misery!&nbsp;
I arrived in Pittsburg.&nbsp; It was raining, and the black pall
of smoke which always clothes the town was denser than ever, and
the long black streamers which hung everywhere as mourning made
the whole place unutterably ghastly.&nbsp; In the trains nothing
but the murder was spoken of.&nbsp; There was a young man who had
been in the theatre and witnessed the murder, which he described
graphically and evidently truthfully.</p>
<p>I reached Cincinnati, and as soon as possible hurried on board
the steamboat.&nbsp; We went along to Charleston, and it will
hardly be believed that I very nearly missed the whole object of
my journey by falling asleep.&nbsp; We had but one more very
short distance to go, when, overcome by fatigue, I dropped into a
nap.&nbsp; Fortunately I was awakened by the last <!-- page
299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>ringing of the bell, and, seizing my carpet-bag, ran
ashore just as the plank was to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>I went directly to Goshorn&rsquo;s hotel.&nbsp; He was a
stout, burly man, shrewd in his way, good-natured, but not
without temper and impulses.&nbsp; He looked keenly after
business, played the fiddle, and performed a few tricks of
legerdemain.&nbsp; He had a ladylike wife, and both were very
kind to me, especially after they came to know me pretty
well.&nbsp; The lady had a nice, easy horse, which ere long was
lent me freely whenever I wanted to ride.&nbsp; One day it was
missing.&nbsp; The master grieved.&nbsp; They had named it after
me in compliment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goshorn,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in
future I shall call <i>you Horse-gone</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he
was not pleased with the name.&nbsp; However, it was recovered by
a miracle, for the amount of horse-stealing which went on about
us then was fabulous.</p>
<p>After a few days Goshorn and I prepared to go up Elk River, to
renew the leases of oil and coal lands.&nbsp; Now I must premise
that at all times the man who was engaged in &ldquo;ile&rdquo;
bore a charmed life, and was venerated by both Union men and
rebels.&nbsp; <i>He</i> could pass the lines and go
anywhere.&nbsp; At one time, when not a spy could be got into or
out of Richmond to serve us, Goshorn seriously proposed to me to
go with him into the city!&nbsp; I had a neighbour named Fassit,
an uncle of Theodore.&nbsp; He had oil-wells in Virginia, and
when the war begun work on them was stopped.&nbsp; This dismayed
the natives.&nbsp; One morning there came to Mr. Fassit a letter
imploring him to return: &ldquo;Come back, o come agin and bore
us some more wels.&nbsp; We wil protec you like a son.&nbsp; We
dont make war on <i>Ile</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I, being thus
respected, went and came from the Foeman&rsquo;s Land, and joined
in the dreadful rebel-ry and returned unharmed, leading a charmed
if <i>not</i> particularly charming life all winter and the
spring, to the great amazement and bewilderment of many, as will
appear in the sequence.</p>
<p>The upper part of Elk River was in the debatable land, or
rather still in Slave-ownia or rebeldom, where a Union <!-- page
300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>man&rsquo;s life was worth about a chinquapin.&nbsp; In
fact, one day there was a small battle between me and
home&mdash;with divers wounds and deaths.&nbsp; This going and
coming of mine, among and with rebels, got me into a droll
misunderstanding some time after.&nbsp; But I think that the real
cause lay less in oil than in the simple truth that these frank,
half-wild fellows <i>liked</i> me.&nbsp; One said to me one day,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re onlike all the Northern men who come here,
and we all like you.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I explained it that he had only met with Yankees, and that as
Pennsylvania lay next to Virginia, of course we must be more
alike as neighbours.&nbsp; But the cause lay in the <i>liking</i>
which I have for Indians, gypsies, and all such folk.</p>
<p>Goshorn began by buying a dug-out poplar canoe sixty-four feet
in length, and stocking it with provisions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Money
won&rsquo;t be of much use,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what we want
chiefly is whisky and blue beads for presents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
hired two men who had been in the Confederate army, but who had
absented themselves since the proceedings had become
uninteresting.&nbsp; These men took to me with a devotion which
ended by becoming literally superstitious.&nbsp; I am quite sure
that, while naturally intelligent, anything like a mind stored
with varied knowledge was something <i>utterly</i> unknown to
them.&nbsp; And as I, day by day, let fall unthinkingly this or
that scrap of experience or of knowledge, they began to regard me
as a miracle.&nbsp; One day one of them, Sam Fox, said to me
meaningly, that I liked curious things, and that he knew a nest
where he could get me a young <i>raven</i>.&nbsp; The raven is to
an Indian conjuror what a black cat is to a witch, and I suppose
that Sam thought I must be lonely without a familiar.&nbsp; Which
recalls one of the most extraordinary experiences of all my
life.</p>
<p>During my return down the river, it was in a freshet, and we
went headlong.&nbsp; This is to the very last degree dangerous,
unless the boatmen know every rock and point, for the dugout
canoe goes over at a touch, and there is no life to be <!-- page
301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>saved in the rapids.&nbsp; Now we were flying like a
swallow, and could not stop.&nbsp; There was one narrow shoot, or
pass, just in the middle of the river, where there was exactly
room to an inch for a canoe to pass, but to do this it was
necessary to have moonlight enough to see the King Rock, which
rose in the stream close by the passage, and at the critical
instant to &ldquo;fend off&rdquo; with the hand and prevent the
canoe from driving full on the rock.&nbsp; A terrible storm was
coming up, thunder was growling afar, and clouds fast gathering
in the sky.</p>
<p>The men had heard me talking the day before as to how storms
were formed in circles, and it had deeply impressed them.&nbsp;
When Goshorn asked them what we had better do, they said,
&ldquo;Leave it all to Mr. Leland; he knows
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at the moon and saw that the
clouds were not driving dead against it, but <i>around</i> while
closing in, and I know not by what strange inspiration I added,
&ldquo;You will have just time to clear King Rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still far away.&nbsp; I laid down my paddle and drew my
blanket round me, and smoked to the storm, and sang incantations
to myself.&nbsp; It was a fearful trial, actually risking death,
but I felt no fear&mdash;only a dull confidence in fate.&nbsp;
Closer grew the clouds&mdash;darker the sky&mdash;when during the
very last second of light King Rock came in sight.&nbsp; Goshorn
was ready with his bull-like strength and gave the push; and just
as we shot clear into the channel it became dark as pitch, and
the rain came down in a torrent.&nbsp; Goshorn pitched his hat
high into the air&mdash;<i>aux moulins</i>&mdash;and hurrahed and
cried in exulting joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Leland, sing us that German song you&rsquo;re
always so jolly with&mdash;<i>lodle yodle tol de rol de
rol</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that hour I was <i>Kchee-Bo-o-in</i> or Grand Pow-wow to
Sam Fox and his friends.&nbsp; He believed in me, even as I
believe in myself when such mad &ldquo;spells&rdquo; come over
me.&nbsp; One day he proved his confidence.&nbsp; It was bright
and sunshiny, and we were paddling along when we saw a
&ldquo;summer <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>duck&rdquo; swimming perhaps fifty
yards ahead.&nbsp; Sam was sitting in the bow exactly between me
and the duck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire at it with your revolver!&rdquo;
cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too far away,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and you
are right in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam bent over sideways, glaring at me with his one strange
eye.&nbsp; It was just about as close a shot as was William
Tell&rsquo;s at the apple.&nbsp; But I knew that reputation for
nerve depended on it, so I fired.&nbsp; As the duck rose it
dropped a feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d hit!&rdquo; cried Sam
triumphantly.&nbsp; And so I had, but I should not like to try
that shot again.</p>
<p>Reflex action of the brain and secondary automatism!&nbsp; It
must be so&mdash;Haeckel, thou reasonest well.&nbsp; But when the
&ldquo;old Injun&rdquo; and my High-Dutch ancestor are upon me, I
reason not at all, and then I see visions and dream dreams, and
it always comes true, without the <i>least</i> self-deception or
delusion.</p>
<p>It is a marvellous thing that in these canoes, which tip over
so easily, men will pass over mill-dams ten or twelve feet high,
as I myself have done many a time, without upsetting.&nbsp; The
manner of it is this.&nbsp; The canoe is a log hollowed
out.&nbsp; This is allowed to pass over till it dips like a
seesaw, or falls into the stream below.&nbsp; It is a dangerous,
reckless act, but generally succeeds.&nbsp; One day Sam Fox
undertook to shoot our dug-out over a fall.&nbsp; So he paddled
hard, and ran the canoe headlong to edge, he being in the
bow.&nbsp; But it stuck halfway, and there was my Samuel, ere he
knew it, high in the air, paddling in the atmosphere, into which
thirty feet of canoe was raised.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the legal business and renewal of the leases and
the payment of money was performed accurately and
punctually.&nbsp; Talk about <i>manna</i> in the wilderness!
<i>money</i> in the wilderness came to the poor souls
impoverished by the war as a thousandfold nicer.&nbsp; But over
and above that, half a pound of coffee or a drink of whisky would
cause a thrill <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>of delight.&nbsp; One day, stopping
at a logger&rsquo;s camp, I gave a decent-looking man a tin cup
full of whisky.&nbsp; The first thing he did was to put it to the
mouth of a toddling two-year-old child and it took a good
pull.&nbsp; I remonstrated with him for it, when he replied,
&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, we get it so seldom, that whisky is a
kind o&rsquo; <i>delicacy</i> with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes the log huts were twenty miles apart.&nbsp; In such
isolation there is no rivalry of ostentation, and men care only
to <i>live</i>.&nbsp; One day we came to a log house.&nbsp; The
occupant had several hundred acres of very good land, and only a
half acre under cultivation.&nbsp; He was absent at a county
court for amusement.&nbsp; All that I could see in the cabin was
a rude seat, an iron pot and spoon, and a squirrel-gun.&nbsp;
There were two cavities or holes in the bare earth floor, in
which the old man and his wife slept, each wrapped in a
blanket.&nbsp; Even our boatman said that such carelessness was
unusual.&nbsp; But all were ignorant of a thousand refinements of
life of which the poorest English peasant <i>knows</i> something,
yet every one of these people had an independence or pride far
above all poverty.</p>
<p>One night we stopped at the house of a man who was said to
possess $150,000 (&pound;30,000) worth of land.&nbsp; The house
was well enough.&nbsp; His two bare-legged daughters, girls of
seventeen or eighteen, lounged about smoking pipes.&nbsp; I gave
one a cigar.&nbsp; She replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keer if I do
try it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve allays wanted to know what a cigar
smokes like.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp;
Apropos of girls, I may say that there is a <i>far</i> higher
standard of morals among these people than among the ignorant
elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was indeed a wild country.&nbsp; One day Goshorn showed me
a hill, and a hunter had told him that when standing on it one
summer afternoon he had seen in a marshy place the very unusual
spectacle of forty bears, all wallowing together in the mud and
playing at once.&nbsp; Also the marks of a bear&rsquo;s claws on
a tree.&nbsp; Game was plenty in this region.&nbsp; All the time
that I stayed with Goshorn we had every day at his <!-- page
304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>well-furnished table bear&rsquo;s meat, venison, or
other game, fish, ham, chickens, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of very beautiful scenery on Elk River,
and some of its &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; were marvellously
strange.&nbsp; The hard sandstone rocks had worn into shapes
resembling castles and houses, incredibly like buildings made by
man.&nbsp; One day I saw and copied a vast square rock through
which ran to the light a perfect Gothic archway sixty feet high,
with a long wall like the side of a castle, and an immense square
tower.&nbsp; There are the most natural-looking houses and
Schl&ouml;sser imaginable rising all alone in the forest.&nbsp;
Very often the summits of the hills were crowned with round
towers.&nbsp; On the Ohio River there is a group of these shaped
like segments of a truncated cone, and &ldquo;corniced&rdquo;
with another piece reversed, like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p304.jpg">
<img alt="Round tower" src="images/p304.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>These are called &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Tea-tables.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I drew them several times, but could never give them the
appearance of being <i>natural</i> objects.&nbsp; It is very
extraordinary how Nature seems to have mocked man in advance in
these structures.&nbsp; In Fingal&rsquo;s Cave there is an
absolutely original style of architecture.</p>
<p>The last house which we came to was the best.&nbsp; In it
dwelt a gentlemanly elderly man with two ladylike
daughters.&nbsp; His son, who was dressed in &ldquo;store
clothes,&rdquo; had been a delegate to the Wheeling
Convention.&nbsp; But the war had <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>borne hard
on them, and for a long time <i>everything</i> which they used or
wore had been made by their own hands.&nbsp; They had a home-made
loom and spinning-wheel&mdash;I saw several such looms on the
river; they raised their own cotton and wool and maple sugar, and
were in all important details utterly self-sustaining and
independent.&nbsp; And they did not live rudely at all, but like
ladies and gentlemen, as really intelligent people always can
when they are <i>free</i>.&nbsp; The father had, not long before,
standing in his own door, shot a deer as it looked over the
garden gate at him.&nbsp; Goshorn, observing that I attached some
value to the horns (a new idea to him), secured them for
himself.</p>
<p>A day or two after, while descending the river, we stopped to
see an old hunter who lived on the bank.&nbsp; He was a very
shrewd, quaint old boy, &ldquo;good for a novel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
examined Goshorn&rsquo;s spectacles with so much interest, that I
suspect it was really the first time in his life that he ever
fully ascertained the &ldquo;true inwardness and
utilitarianism&rdquo; of such objects.&nbsp; He expressed great
admiration, and said that if he had them he could get twice as
many deer as he did.&nbsp; I promised to send him a pair.&nbsp; I
begged from him deer-horns, which he gave me very willingly,
expressing wonder that I wanted such rubbish, and at my
delight.&nbsp; And seeing that my companion had a pair, he said
scornfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Goshorn, what do <i>you</i> know about such
things?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s set <i>you</i> to gittin&rsquo;
deer&rsquo;s horns?&nbsp; Give &rsquo;em to this here young
gentleman, who understands such things that we don&rsquo;t, and
who wants &rsquo;em fur some good reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will do Goshorn the justice to say that he gave them to me
for a parting present.&nbsp; My room at his house was quite
devoid of all decoration, but by arranging on the walls crossed
canoe-paddles, great bunches of the picturesque locust-thorn,
often nearly a foot in length, and the deer&rsquo;s horns, I made
it look rather more human.&nbsp; But this arrangement utterly
bewildered the natives, especially the maids, who naively asked
me why I hung them old bones and thorns up in my room.&nbsp; <!--
page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>As this thorn is much used by the blacks in Voodoo, I
suppose that it was all explained by being set down to my
&ldquo;conjurin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid who attended to my room was a very nice, good girl,
but one who could not have been understood in England.&nbsp; I
found that she gathered up and treasured many utterly worthless
trifling bits of pen-drawing which I threw away.&nbsp; She
explained that where she came from on Coal River, anything like a
picture was a great curiosity; also that her friends believed
that all the pictures in books, newspapers, &amp;c., were drawn
by hand.&nbsp; I explained to her how they were made.&nbsp; When
<i>I</i> left I offered her two dollars.&nbsp; She hesitated, and
then said, &ldquo;Mr. Leland, there have been many, many
gentlemen here who have offered me money, but I never took a cent
from any man till <i>now</i>.&nbsp; And I <i>will</i> take this
from you to buy something that I can remember you by, for you
have always treated me kindly and like a lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
rural America such girls are really lady-helps, and not
&ldquo;servants,&rdquo; albeit those who know how to get on with
them find them the very best servants in the world; but they must
be treated as <i>friends</i>.</p>
<p>I went up Elk River several times on horse or in canoe to
renew leases or to lease new land, &amp;c.&nbsp; The company sent
on a very clever and intelligent rather young man named Sandford,
who had been a railroad superintendent, to help me.&nbsp; I liked
him very much.&nbsp; We had a third, a young Virginian, named
Finnal.&nbsp; At or near Cannelton I selected a spot where we put
up a steam-engine, and began to bore for oil.&nbsp; It was very
near the famous gas-well which once belonged to General
Washington.&nbsp; This well gave forth every week the equivalent
of <i>one hundred and fifty</i> tons of coal.&nbsp; It was
utilised in a factory.&nbsp; After I sunk our shaft it gave out;
but I do not believe that we stopped it, for no gas came into our
well.&nbsp; Finnal was the superintendent of the well.&nbsp; One
day he nearly sat down&mdash;<i>nudo podice</i>&mdash;on an
immense rattlesnake.&nbsp; He had a little cottage and a fine
horse.&nbsp; He <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>kept the latter in a stable and
painted the door <i>white</i>, so that when waking in the night
he could see if any horse-thief had opened it.&nbsp; Many efforts
were made to rob him of it.</p>
<p>At this time Lee&rsquo;s army was disbanded, and fully
one-half came straggling in squads up the valley to Charleston to
be paroled.&nbsp; David Goshorn&rsquo;s hotel was simply crammed
with Confederate officers, who slept anywhere.&nbsp; With these I
easily became friends; they seemed like Princeton Southern
college mates.&nbsp; Now I have to narrate a strange story.&nbsp;
One evening when I was sitting and smoking on the portico with
some of these <i>bons compagnons</i> I said to one&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say that your men never once during the war got
within sight of Harrisburg or of a Northern city.&nbsp; But I
believe they did.&nbsp; One day when I was on guard I saw five
men scout on the bank in full sight of it.&nbsp; But nobody
agreed with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer laughed silently, and cried aloud to a friend with
a broken arm in a sling, who lay within a room on a bed,
&ldquo;Come out here, L---.&nbsp; Here is something which will
interest you more than anything you ever heard before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came out, and, having heard my story, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever believed your story, nor did anybody ever
believe mine.&nbsp; Mine is this&mdash;that when we were at
Sporting Hill a corporal of mine came in and declared that he and
his men had scouted into within full sight of Harrisburg.&nbsp; I
knew that the man told the truth, but nobody else would believe
that any human being dared to do such a thing, or could do
it.&nbsp; And now you fully prove that it was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came to Goshorn&rsquo;s three very interesting men with
whom I became intimate.&nbsp; One was Robert Hunt, of St.
Louis.&nbsp; He was of a very good Virginia family, had been at
Princeton College, ran away in his sixteenth year, took to the
plains as a hunter, and for twenty-three years had ranged the
Wild West from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific.&nbsp; At the
end of the time an uncle in the Fur Company had helped him on,
and he was now rich.&nbsp; He was one of the <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>most
genial, gay, and festive, reckless yet always gentlemanly men I
ever knew.&nbsp; He expressed great astonishment, as he learned
gradually to know me, at finding we were so congenial, and that I
had so much &ldquo;real Injun&rdquo; in me.&nbsp; His eyes were
first opened to this great fact by a very singular incident, of
which I can never think without pleasure.</p>
<p>Hunt, with two men who had been cavalry captains all through
the war, and his friend Ross, who had long been an Indian trader,
and I, were all riding up Elk Valley to look at lands.&nbsp; We
paused at a place where the road sloped sideways and was wet with
rain.&nbsp; As I was going to remount, I asked a German who stood
by to hold my horse&rsquo;s head, and sprang into the
saddle.&nbsp; Just at this critical instant&mdash;it all passed
in a second&mdash;as the German had not heard me, my horse,
feeling that he must fall over on his left side from my weight,
threw himself <i>completely over backward</i>.&nbsp; As quick as
thought I jumped up on his back, put my foot just between the
saddle and his tail, and took a tremendous flying leap so far
that I cleared the horse.&nbsp; I only muddied the palms of my
gloves, on which I fell.</p>
<p>The elder cavalry captain said, &ldquo;When I saw that horse
go over backwards, I closed my eyes and held my breath, for I
expected the next second to see you killed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Robert Hunt exclaimed, &ldquo;Good as an Injun, by
God!&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I some time after made fun of it, he
shook his head gravely and reprovingly, as George Ward did over
the gunpowder, and said, &ldquo;It was a <i>magnificent</i>
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very afternoon Hunt distinguished himself in a manner
which was quite as becoming an aborigine.&nbsp; I was acting as
guide, and knowing that there was a ford across a tributary of
the Elk, sought and thought I had found it.&nbsp; But I was
mistaken, and what was horrible, we found ourselves in a deep
quicksand.&nbsp; On such occasions horses become, as it were,
insane, trying to throw the riders and then jump on them for
support.&nbsp; By good luck we got out of it soon, but there was
an <i>awful</i> five minutes of kicking, plunging, <!-- page
309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>splashing, and &ldquo;ground and lofty&rdquo;
swearing.&nbsp; I got across dry by drawing my legs up before me
on the saddle, <i>&agrave; la</i> tailor, but the others were
badly wet.&nbsp; But no sooner had we emerged from the stream
than Robert Hunt, bursting into a tremendous &ldquo;<i>Ho</i>!
<i>ho</i>!&rdquo; of deep laughter, declared that he had shown
more presence of mind during the emergency than any of us; for,
brandishing his whisky flask, he declared that while his horse
was in the flurry it occurred to him that the best thing he could
do was to lighten the load, and he had therefore, with incredible
presence of mind, drunk up all the whisky!</p>
<p>However, he afterwards confessed to me that the true reason
was that, believing death was at hand, and thinking it a pity to
die thirsty, he had drained the bottle, as did the old Indian
woman just as she went over the Falls of Niagara.&nbsp; Anyhow,
the incorrigible <i>vaurien</i> had really emptied his flask
while in the &ldquo;quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I say it, I believe that Hunt and I were a pretty well
matched couple, and many a wild prank and Indian-like joke did we
play together.&nbsp; More than once he expressed great
astonishment that I, a man grown up in cities and to literary
pursuits, should be so much at home where he found me, or so
congenial.&nbsp; He had been at Princeton, and, <i>ex pede
Herculem</i>, had a point whence to judge me, but it failed. <a
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309"
class="citation">[309]</a>&nbsp; His friend Ross was a quiet,
sensible New Englander, who reminded me of Artemus Ward, or
Charles Browne.&nbsp; He abounded in quaint anecdotes of Indian
experiences.</p>
<p>As did also a Mr. Wadsworth, who had passed half his life in
the Far West as a surveyor among the Chippeways.&nbsp; He had
written a large manuscript of their legends, of which Schoolcraft
made great use in his <i>Algic</i> book.&nbsp; I believe that
much of Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Hiawatha</i> owed its origin thus
indirectly <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>to Mr. Wadsworth.&nbsp; In after
years I wrote out many of his tales, as told to me, in articles
in <i>Temple Bar</i>.</p>
<p>The country all about Charleston was primitively wild and
picturesque, rocky, hilly, and leading to solitary life and
dreams of <i>sylvani</i> and forest fairies.&nbsp; There were
fountained hills, and dreamy darkling woods, and old Indian
graves, and a dancing stream, across which lay a petrified tree,
and everywhere a little travelled land.&nbsp; I explored it with
Goshorn, riding far and wide into remote mountain recesses, to
get the signatures in attestation of men who could rarely write,
but on the other hand could &ldquo;shoot their mark&rdquo; with a
rifle to perfection, and who would assuredly have placed such
signature on me had I not been a holy messenger of <i>Ile</i>,
and an angel of coming moneyed times.</p>
<p>One day we stopped at a farm-house in a wild, lonely
place.&nbsp; There was only an old woman there&mdash;one of the
stern, resolute, hard-muscled frontier women, the daughters of
mothers who had fought &ldquo;Injuns&rdquo;&mdash;and a
calf.&nbsp; And thereby hung a tale, which the three men with me
fully authenticated.</p>
<p>The whole country thereabouts had been for four years so
worried, harried, raided, raked, plundered, and foraged by
Federals and Confederates&mdash;one day the former, the next the
latter; blue and grey, or sky and sea&mdash;that the old lady had
nothing left to live on.&nbsp; Hens, cows, horses, corn, all had
gone save one calf, the Benjamin and idol of her heart.</p>
<p>One night she heard a piteous baaing, and, seizing a broom,
rushed to the now henless hen-house, in which she kept the calf,
to find in it a full-grown panther attacking her pet.&nbsp; By
this time the old lady had grown desperate, and seizing the
broom, she proceeded to &ldquo;lam&rdquo; the wild beast with the
handle, and with all her heart; and the fiend of ferocity,
appalled at her attack, fled.&nbsp; I saw the calf with the marks
of the panther&rsquo;s claws, not yet quite healed; I saw the
broom; and, lastly, I saw the old woman, the mother in Ishmael;
whose face was a perfect guarantee of the truth of the
story.&nbsp; One of us suggested that the old lady should have
<!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>the calf&rsquo;s hide tanned and wear it as a trophy,
like an Indian, which would have been a strange reversal of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s application of it, or to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hang a calf-skin on those recreant
limbs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there came the great spring freshet in Elk River, which
rose unusually high, fifty feet above its summer level.&nbsp; It
had come to within an inch or two of my floor, and yet I went to
bed and to sleep.&nbsp; By a miracle it rose no more, for I had a
distinct conviction it would not, which greatly amazed
everybody.&nbsp; But many were drowned all about us.&nbsp; The
next day a man who professed bone-setting and doctoring, albeit
not diplomaed, asked me to go with him and act as interpreter to
a German patient who had a broken thigh.&nbsp; While felling a
tree far away in the forest, it thundered down on him, and kept
him down for two or three days till he was discovered.&nbsp; To
get to him we went in a small canoe, and paddled ourselves with
shingles or wooden tiles, used to cover roofs.&nbsp; On the way I
saw a man on a roof fiddling; only a bit of the roof was above
water.&nbsp; He was waiting for deliverance.&nbsp; Many and
strange indeed were all the scenes and incidents of that
inundation, and marvellous the legends which were told of other
freshets in the days of yore.</p>
<p>I never could learn to play cards.&nbsp; Destiny forbade it,
and always stepped in promptly to stop all such
proceedings.&nbsp; One night Sandford and friends sat down to
teach me poker, when <i>bang</i>, <i>bang</i>, went a revolver
outside, and a bullet buried itself in the door close by
me.&nbsp; A riotous, evil-minded darkey, who attended to my
washing, had got into a fight, and was forthwith conveyed to the
Bull-pen, or military prison.&nbsp; I was afraid lest I might
lose my shirts, and so &ldquo;visited him&rdquo; next day and
found him in irons, but reading a newspaper at his ease.&nbsp;
From him I learned the address of &ldquo;the coloured lady&rdquo;
who had my underclothing.</p>
<p>The Bull-pen was a picturesque place&mdash;a large log
enclosure, full of strange inmates, such as wild guerillas in
<!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>moccasins, grey-back Confederates and blue-coat
Federals guilty of many a murder, arson, and much horse-stealing,
desolate deserters, often deserving pity&mdash;the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a four years&rsquo; war, the crumbs of
the great loaf fallen to the dirt.</p>
<p>Warm weather came on, and I sent to Philadelphia for a summer
suit of clothes.&nbsp; It came, and it was of a <i>light grey
colour</i>.&nbsp; At that time Oxford &ldquo;dittos,&rdquo; or a
suit <i>pareil partout</i>, were unknown in West Virginia.&nbsp;
I was dressed from head to foot in Confederate grey.&nbsp; Such a
daring defiance of public opinion, coupled with my mysterious
stealing into the rebel country, made me an object of awe and
suspicion&mdash;a kind of Sir Grey Steal!</p>
<p>There was at that time in Charleston a German artillery
regiment which really held the town&mdash;that is to say, the
height which commanded it.&nbsp; I had become acquainted with its
officers.&nbsp; All at once they gave me the cold shoulder and
cut me.&nbsp; My friend Sandford was very intimate with
them.&nbsp; One evening he asked their Colonel why they scorned
me.&nbsp; The Colonel replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pecause he&rsquo;s a tamned repel.&nbsp; Aferypody
knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandford at once explained that I was even known at Washington
as a good Union man, and had, moreover, translated Heine, adding
other details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gott verdammich&mdash;<i>heiss</i>!&rdquo; cried the
Colonel in amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is dot der Karl Leland vot
dranslate de <i>Reisebilder</i>?&nbsp; Herr je!&nbsp; I hafe got
dat very pook here on mein table!&nbsp; Look at it.&nbsp; Bei
Gott! here&rsquo;s his name!&nbsp; <i>Dot</i> is der crate Leland
vot edit de <i>Continental Magazine</i>!&nbsp; Dot moost pe a
fery deep man.&nbsp; Und I dink <i>he</i> vas a repel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning early the Colonel sent his ambulance or army
waggon to my hotel with a request that I would come and take
breakfast with him.&nbsp; It was a bit of Heidelberg life over
again.&nbsp; We punished Rheinwein and lager-beer in
quantities.&nbsp; There were old German students among the
officers, and I was received like a brother.</p>
<p>At last Sandford and I determined to return to the East.&nbsp;
<!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>There was in the hotel a coloured waiter named
Harrison.&nbsp; He had been a slave, but &ldquo;a
gentleman&rsquo;s gentleman,&rdquo; was rather dignified, and
allowed no ordinary white man to joke with him.&nbsp; On the
evening before my departure I said to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Harrison, I hope that you haven&rsquo;t quite so
bad an opinion of me as the other people here seem to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He manifested at once a really violent emotion.&nbsp; Dashing
something to the ground, he cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Leland, you <i>never</i> did anything contrary to a
gentleman.&nbsp; I always maintained it.&nbsp; Now please tell me
the truth.&nbsp; Is it true that you&rsquo;re a great friend of
Jeff Davis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Jeff Davis!&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ain&rsquo;t a major in the Confederate
service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a clear-down Abolitionist, and was born
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ain&rsquo;t had no goings on with the rebels up
the river to bring back the Confederacy here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a dealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And therewith I explained how it was that I went unharmed up
into the rebels&rsquo; country, and great was the joy of
Harrison, who, as I found, had taken my part valiantly against
those who suspected me.</p>
<p>There was a droll comedy the next day on board the steamboat
on which I departed.&nbsp; A certain Mr. H., who had been a rebel
and recanted at the eleventh hour and become a Federal official,
requested everybody on board not to notice me.&nbsp; Sandford
learned it all, and chuckled over it.&nbsp; But the captain and
mate and crew were all still rebels at heart.&nbsp; Great was my
amazement at being privately informed by the steward that the
captain requested as a favour that I would sit by him at dinner
and share a bottle of wine.&nbsp; I did so, and while I remained
on board was treated as an honoured guest.</p>
<p>And now I would here distinctly declare that, apart from my
political principles, from which I never swerved, I always found
the rebels&mdash;that is, Southern and Western men with <!-- page
314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>whom I had had intimate dealings&mdash;without one
exception <i>personally</i> the most congenial and agreeable
people whom I had ever met.&nbsp; There was not to be found among
them what in England is known as a prig.&nbsp; They were natural
and gentlemanly, even down to the poorest and most
uneducated.</p>
<p>One day Sam Fox came to me and asked me to use my influence
with the Cannelton Company to get him employment at their
works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
it.&nbsp; It is only three weeks now, when you were employed at
another place, that you tried to stuff the overseer into the
furnace, and if the men had not prevented, you would have burned
him up alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;but he had called me a
-- son --- of ---.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and if he had
called me <i>that</i>, I should have done the same.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t think, if I <i>had</i> done it, I should ever have
expected to be employed again on another furnace.&nbsp; You see,
Samuel, my son, that these Northern men have very queer
notions&mdash;<i>very</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was quite convinced.</p>
<p>At Cincinnati a trifling but droll incident occurred.&nbsp; I
do not set myself up for a judge of wines, but I have naturally a
delicate sense of smell or <i>flair</i>, though not the
extraordinary degree in which my brother possessed it, who never
drank wine at all.&nbsp; He was the first person who ever, in
printed articles or in lectures, insisted that South New Jersey
was suitable for wine-growing.&nbsp; At the hotel Sandford asked
me if I could tell any wine by the taste.&nbsp; I replied No, but
I would try; so they gave me a glass of some kind, and I said
that honestly I could only declare that I should say it was
Portugal common country wine, but I must be wrong.&nbsp; Then
Sandford showed the bottle, and the label declared it to be grown
in Ohio.&nbsp; The next day he came to me and said, &ldquo;I
believe that after all you know a great deal about wine.&nbsp; I
told the landlord what you said, and he laughed, arid said,
&lsquo;I had not the American wine which you called for, and so I
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>gave you a cheap but unusual Portuguese
wine.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This wine is neither white nor red, and
tastes like sherry and Burgundy mixed.</p>
<p>At Cincinnati, Sandford proposed that we should return by way
of Detroit and Niagara.&nbsp; I objected to the expense, but he,
who knew every route and rate by heart, explained to me that,
owing to the competition in railway rates, it would only cost me
six shillings ($1.50) more, <i>plus</i> $2.50 (ten shillings)
from New York to Philadelphia.&nbsp; So we departed.&nbsp; In
Detroit I called on my cousin, Benjamin Stimson (the S. of
&ldquo;Two Years before the Mast&rdquo;), and found him a
prominent citizen.&nbsp; So, skirting along southern Canada, we
got to Niagara, and thence to Albany and down the Hudson to New
York, and so on to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It seems to me now that at this time all trace of my former
life and self had vanished.&nbsp; I seemed to be only prompt to
the saddle, canoe-paddle, revolver, steamboat, and
railroad.&nbsp; My wife said that after this and other periods of
Western travel I was always for three weeks as wild as an Indian,
and so I most truly and unaffectedly was.&nbsp; I did not
<i>act</i> in a foolish or disorderly manner at all, but
Tennessee and Elk River were in me.&nbsp; Robert Hunt and Sam Fox
and many more had expressed their amazement at the amount of
extremely familiar and congenial nature which they had found in
me, and they were quite right.&nbsp; Sam and Goshorn declared
that I was the only Northern man whom they had ever known who
ever learned to paddle a dug-out <i>correctly</i>; but as I was
obliged to do this sometimes for fifteen hours a day <i>nolens
volens</i>, it is not remarkable that I became an expert.</p>
<p>As regards the real unaffected feeling of wildness born to
savage nature, life, and association, it is absolutely as
different from all civilised feeling whatever as bird from fish;
and it very rarely happens that an educated man ever knows what
it is.&nbsp; What there is of it in me which Indians recognise
is, I believe, entirely due to hereditary endowment.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>&ldquo;Zum Wald, zum Wald, steht mir
mein Sinn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So einzig, ach! so einzig hin.<br />
Dort lebt man freundlich, lebt man froh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und nirgends, nirgends lebt man so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not come from reading or culture&mdash;it comes of
itself by nature, or not at all; nor has it over-much to do with
thought.&nbsp; Only in something like superstition can it find
expression, but that must be childlike and sweet and sincere, and
without the giggling with which such subjects are invariably
received by ladies in society.</p>
<p>I went with my wife and her mother and sister to pass some
time at Bethlehem, in Pennsylvania, which we did very pleasantly
at a country inn.&nbsp; It is a very interesting town, where a
peculiar German dialect is generally spoken.&nbsp; There was a
very respectable wealthy middle-aged lady, a Pennsylvanian by
birth, who avoided meeting us at table because she could not
speak English.&nbsp; And when I was introduced to her, I made
matters worse by speaking to her naturally in broad South German,
whereupon she informed me that she spoke
<i>Hoch</i>-Deutsch!&nbsp; But I made myself popular among the
natives with my German, and our landlord was immensely proud of
me.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;one of dem city fellers dat
shames demselfs of de Dutch,&rdquo; not I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vy, I
dells you vot, mein Gott! he&rsquo;s <i>proud</i> of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ended the summer at beautiful Lenox, in Massachusetts, in
the charming country immortalised in &ldquo;Elsie Venner&rdquo;;
of which work, and my letter on it to Dr. Holmes, and my
conversation with him thereanent, I might fill a chapter.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;let us not talk about them but pass on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
returned to Philadelphia and to my father&rsquo;s house, where I
remained one year.</p>
<p>I had for a long time, at intervals, been at work on a book to
be entitled the &ldquo;Origin of American Popular
Phrases.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had scissored from newspapers, collected
from negro minstrels and Western rustics, and innumerable New
England friends, as well as books and old songs and comic
almanacs <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>and the like, a vast amount of
valuable material.&nbsp; This work, which had cost me altogether
a full year&rsquo;s labour, had been accepted by a New York
publisher, and was in the printer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; I never
awaited anything with such painful anxiety as I did this
publication, for I had never been in such straits nor needed
money so much, and it seemed as if the more earnestly I sought
for employment the more it evaded me.&nbsp; And then almost as
soon as my manuscript was in the printer&rsquo;s hands his office
was burned, and the work perished, for I had not kept a copy.</p>
<p>It was a great loss, but from the instant when I heard of it
to this day I never had five minutes&rsquo; trouble over it, and
more probably not one.&nbsp; I had done my <i>very best</i> to
make a good book and some money, and could do no more.&nbsp; When
I was a very small boy I was deeply impressed with the story in
the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; of the prisoner who knew that he
was going to be set free because a rat had run away with his
dinner.&nbsp; So I, at the age of seven, announced to my father
that I believed that whenever a man had bad luck, good was sure
to follow, which opinion he did not accept.&nbsp; And to this day
I hold it, because, reckoning up the chances of life, it is true
for most people.&nbsp; At any rate, I derived some comfort from
the fact that the accident was reported in all the newspapers all
over the Union.</p>
<p>About the 1st of July, 1866, we left my father&rsquo;s house
to go to Cape May, where we remained for two months.&nbsp; In
September we went to a very good boarding-house in Philadelphia,
kept by Mrs. Sandgren.&nbsp; She possessed and showed me
Tegner&rsquo;s original manuscript of &ldquo;Anna and
Axel.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess that I never cared over-much for
Tegner, and that I infinitely prefer the original Icelandic Saga
of Frithiof to his sago-gruel imitation of strong soup.</p>

<p>We had not lived at Mrs. Sandgren&rsquo;s more than a week
when George Boker, knowing my need, spoke to Colonel <!-- page
319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>John Forney, who was at that time not only Secretary of
the Senate of the United States, but the proprietor of the
<i>Chronicle</i> newspaper in Washington, of the <i>Press</i> in
Philadelphia, &ldquo;both daily,&rdquo; as the Colonel once said,
which very simple and commonplace expression became a popular
by-word.&nbsp; Colonel Forney wanted a managing editor for the
<i>Press</i>, and, as I found in due time, not so much a man of
enterprise and a leader&mdash;that <i>he</i> supplied&mdash;nor
yet one to practically run the journal&mdash;that his son John, a
young man of eighteen, supplied&mdash;so much as a steady,
trustworthy, honest <i>pivot</i> on which the compass could turn
during his absences&mdash;and that <i>I</i> supplied.&nbsp; I
must, to explain the situation, add gently that John, who could
not help it considering his experiences, was, to put it mildly, a
little irregular, rendering a steady manager absolutely
necessary.&nbsp; It was a great pity, for John the junior was
extremely clever as a practical managing editor, remembering
everything, and knowing&mdash;what I never did or could&mdash;all
the little tricks, games, and wiles of all the reporters and
others employed.</p>
<p>Colonel Forney was such a remarkable character, and had such a
great influence for many years in American politics, that as I
had a great deal to do with him&mdash;very much more than was
generally known&mdash;at a time when he struck his greatest
political <i>coup</i>, in which, as he said, I greatly aided him,
I will here dwell on him a space.&nbsp; Before I knew him I
called him Warwick the King-maker, for it was generally admitted
that it was to his intense hatred of Buchanan, added to his
speech-making, editing, and tremendously vigorous and not always
over-scrupulous intriguing, that &ldquo;Ten-cent Jimmy&rdquo;
owed his defeat.&nbsp; At this time, in all presidential
elections, Pennsylvania turned the scale, and John Forney could
and did turn Pennsylvania like a Titan; and he frankly admitted
that he owed the success of his last turn to me, as I shall in
time relate.</p>
<p>Forney&rsquo;s antipathies were always remarkably well
placed.&nbsp; He hated Buchanan; also, for certain personal
reasons, he <!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>hated Simon Cameron; and finally it
came to pass that he hated Andrew Johnson with a hatred of
twenty-four carats&mdash;an <i>aquafortis</i>
detestation&mdash;and for a most singular cause.</p>
<p>One night when this &ldquo;President by the pistol, and
smallest potato in the American garden of liberty,&rdquo; was
making one of his ribald speeches, after having laid out Horace
Greeley, some one in the crowd cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give us <i>John Forney</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an air of infinite contempt the President
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t waste <i>my</i> powder on dead
ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had better have left that word unsaid, for it ruined
him.&nbsp; It woke Colonel John Forney up to the very highest
pitch of his fighting &ldquo;Injun,&rdquo; or, as they say in
Pennsylvania, his &ldquo;Dutch.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had always been
to that hour a genial man, like most politicians, a little too
much given to the social glass.&nbsp; But from that date of the
dead duck he became &ldquo;total abstinence,&rdquo; and
concentrated all his faculties and found all his excitement in
vengeance hot and strong, without a grain of sugar.&nbsp; In
which I gladly sympathised and aided, for I detested Johnson as a
renegade Copperhead, or rather venomous toad to the South, who
wished with all his soul to undo Lincoln&rsquo;s work and bring
in the Confederacy.&nbsp; And I believe, on my life and soul,
that if John Forney had not defeated him, we should have had such
disasters as are now inconceivable, the least of them being a
renewal of the war.&nbsp; Johnson had renegaded from the
Confederacy because, being only a tailor, he had ranked as a
&ldquo;low white,&rdquo; or something despised even by
&ldquo;quality&rdquo; negroes.&nbsp; The Southern aristocracy
humbugged him by promising that if he would betray the Union he
should be regarded as one of themselves, by which very shallow
cheat he was&mdash;as a snob would be&mdash;easily caught, and in
due time cast off.</p>
<p>I had been but a few weeks on the <i>Press</i>, and all was
going on well, when one morning the Colonel abruptly asked me if
I could start in the morning for Fort Riley, of which <!-- page
321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>all I knew was that it constituted an extreme frontier
station in Kansas.&nbsp; There was to be a Kansas Pacific railway
laid out, and a large party of railroad men intended to go as far
as the last surveyor&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; Of course, a few editors
had been invited to write up the road, and these in turn sent
some one in their place.&nbsp; I knew at once that I should have
something like the last year&rsquo;s wild life over again, and I
was delighted.&nbsp; I borrowed John Forney&rsquo;s revolver,
provided an agate-point and &ldquo;manifold paper&rdquo; for
duplicate letters to our &ldquo;two papers, both daily,&rdquo;
and at the appointed hour was at the railway station.&nbsp; There
had been provided for us the director&rsquo;s car, a very large
and extremely comfortable vehicle, with abundance of velvet
&ldquo;settees&rdquo; or divan sofas, with an immense stock of
lobster-salad, cold croquettes, game, with &ldquo;wines of every
fineness,&rdquo; and excellent waiters.&nbsp; The excursion,
indeed, cost &pound;1,000; but it was made to pay, and that to
great profit.</p>
<p>We were all a very genial, congenial party of easy-going
geniuses.&nbsp; There was Hassard, the &ldquo;day editor&rdquo;
of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, who had been with me on the
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, and to whom I was much attached, for he
was a gentlemanly scholar, and withal had seen enough of life on
the <i>Tribune</i> to hold his own with any man; and Captain
William Colton, who had been with me in Tennessee; Robert
Lamborn, who had studied science in Germany, and was now a
railroad man, and many more who are recorded in my pamphlet,
&ldquo;Three Thousand Miles in a Railway Car,&rdquo; and my old
associate, Caspar Souder, of the <i>Bulletin</i>.&nbsp; This
excursion was destined, in connection with this pamphlet, to have
a marvellous effect on my future life.</p>
<p>In every town where we paused&mdash;and our pauses were
frequent, as we travelled very much on the
&ldquo;go-as-you-please&rdquo; plan&mdash;we were received by the
authorities with honour and speeches and invited to dinners or
drinks.&nbsp; Our conductors were courtesy itself.&nbsp; One
afternoon one of them on a rough bit of road said,
&ldquo;Gentlemen, whenever you wish to open a <!-- page 322--><a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>bottle of
champagne, please to pull the cord and stop the train.&nbsp; You
can then drink without spilling your wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went to Chicago and St. Louis, where we were entertained
by Mr. Blow, and where I became acquainted with his daughter
Susan.&nbsp; She was then a beautiful blonde, and, as I soon
found, very intelligent and cultured.&nbsp; She was long years
afterwards busy in founding philanthropic schools in St.
Petersburg, Russia, when I was there&mdash;a singularly noble
woman.&nbsp; However, at this time neither of us dreamed of the
school-keeping which we were to experience in later years.&nbsp;
At this soir&eacute;e, and indeed for the excursion the next day,
we had as a guest Mr. Walter, of the London <i>Times</i>.</p>
<p>The next day we had a special train and an excursion of ladies
and gentlemen to visit the marvellous Knob or Iron
Mountain.&nbsp; This is an immense conical hill with a deep
surrounding dale, beyond which rise other hills all of nearly
solid iron.&nbsp; Returning that evening in the train, a very
strange event took place.&nbsp; There was with us a genial,
pleasant, larky young fellow, one of the famous family of the
MacCooks.&nbsp; When the war came on he was at college&mdash;went
into the army, fought hard&mdash;rose to be captain, and then
after the peace went back to the college and finished his
studies.&nbsp; This was the &ldquo;event.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were
telling stories of dreams; when it came to my turn I
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1860 I had never been in Ohio, nor did I know
anything about it.&nbsp; One night&mdash;it was at Reading,
Pennsylvania&mdash;I fell asleep, I dreamed that I <i>woke
up</i>, rose from the bed, went to the match-box, struck a light,
and while it burned observed the room, which was just the same as
when I had retired.&nbsp; The match went out.&nbsp; I lit
another, when what was my amazement to observe that <i>everything
in the room had changed its colour to a rich brown</i>!&nbsp;
Looking about me, I saw on a kind of <i>&eacute;tag&egrave;re</i>
scores of half-burned candles in candlesticks, as if there had
been a ball.&nbsp; I lighted nearly all of them.&nbsp; Hearing a
sound as of sweeping and the knocking of a broom-handle without,
I went into the next room, which <!-- page 323--><a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>was the
hall where the dance had been held.&nbsp; A very stupid fellow
was sweeping it out.&nbsp; I asked him where I was.&nbsp; He
could not reply intelligently.&nbsp; There came into the hall a
bustling, pleasant woman, rather small, who I saw at a glance was
the housekeeper.&nbsp; She said something to the man as to the
room&rsquo;s being dark.&nbsp; I remarked that there was light
enough in my room, for I had lit all the candles.&nbsp; She
cried, laughing, &lsquo;What extravagance!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
answered, &lsquo;My dear little woman, what does a candle or two
signify to you?&nbsp; Now please tell me where I am.&nbsp; Last
night I went to sleep in Reading, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Where am I
now?&rsquo;&nbsp; She replied (and of this word I was not sure),
&lsquo;In <i>Columbus</i>, Ohio.&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked if there
was any prominent man in the place who was acquainted with
Philadelphia, and who might aid me to return.&nbsp; She
reflected, and said that Judge <i>Duer</i> and his two daughters
(of whom I had never heard) had just returned from the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here MacCook interrupted me eagerly: &ldquo;You were not in
Columbus, but in <i>Dayton</i>, Ohio.&nbsp; And it was not Judge
Duer, but Judge <i>Duey</i>, with his two daughters, who was that
summer in the East.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the room and went into the hall.&nbsp; I came to
the front door.&nbsp; Far down below me I saw a winding river and
a steamboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here MacCook spoke again: &ldquo;That was <i>surely</i>
Dayton.&nbsp; I know the house and the view.&nbsp; But it could
not have been Columbus.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went downstairs too far by mistake into the
cellar.&nbsp; There I found a man sawing wood.&nbsp; I went up
again.&nbsp; [Pray observe that a year <i>after</i>, when I went
West, this very incident occurred one morning in Cincinnati,
Ohio.]&nbsp; I found in the bar-room three respectable-looking
men.&nbsp; I told them my story.&nbsp; One said to the others,
&lsquo;He is always the same old fellow!&rsquo;&nbsp; I stared at
him in amazement.&nbsp; He held out one hand and moved the other
as if fiddling.&nbsp; Monotonous creaking sounds followed, and I
gradually awoke.&nbsp; The same <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>sounds
continued, but they were caused by the grasshoppers and
tree-toads, who pipe monotonously all night long in
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing ever came of the dream, but it all occurred
<i>exactly</i> as I describe it.&nbsp; I have had several quite
as strange.&nbsp; Immediately after I had finished my narration,
some one, alluding to our party, asked if there was any one
present who could sing &ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rsquo;s
Barty,&rdquo; and I astonished them not a little by proclaiming
that I was the author, and by singing it.</p>
<p>We went on to Leavenworth, where we had a dinner at the hotel
which was worthy of Paris.&nbsp; We had, for example, prairie
pullets or half-grown grouse, wild turkeys and tender
venison.&nbsp; Thence to Fort Riley, and so on in waggons to the
last surveyor&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; I forget where it was on the
route that we stopped over-night at a fort, where I found some
old friends and made new ones.&nbsp; A young
officer&mdash;Lieutenant Brown, I think&mdash;gave me a bed in
his cabin.&nbsp; His ceiling was made of canvas.&nbsp; For weeks
he had heard a great rattlesnake moving about on it.&nbsp; One
day he had made a hole in the ceiling and put into it a great
fierce tom-cat.&nbsp; The cat &ldquo;went for&rdquo; the snake
and there was an awful row.&nbsp; After a time the cat came out
looking like a devil with every hair on end, made straight for
the prairie, and was never heard of again.&nbsp; Neither was the
snake.&nbsp; They had finished one another.&nbsp; On another
occasion, when sitting in a similar cabin, my gentle hostess, an
officer&rsquo;s wife, whom I had known a few years before as a
beauty in society, remarked that she had two large rattlesnakes
in her ceiling, and that if we would be silent we might hear them
crawling about.&nbsp; They could not be taken out without
rebuilding the roof.</p>
<p>Captain Colton had just recovered from a very bad attack of
fever and ague, and, being young, had the enormous appetite which
follows weeks of quinine.&nbsp; I saw him this day eat a full
meal of beefsteaks, and then immediately after devour another, at
Brown&rsquo;s, of buffalo-meat.&nbsp; The air of the Plains <!--
page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>causes incredible hunger.&nbsp; We all played a good
knife and fork.</p>
<p>About twilight-tide there came in a very gentlemanly Catholic
priest.&nbsp; I was told that he was a roving missionary.&nbsp;
He led a charmed life, for he went to visit the wildest tribes,
and was everywhere respected.&nbsp; I conversed with him in
French.&nbsp; After a while he spread his blanket, lay down on
the floor and slept till morning, when he read his prayers and
departed.</p>
<p>The next day the fort square was full of Kaw Indians, all in
savage array, about to depart for their autumnal
buffalo-hunt.&nbsp; I met one venerable heathen with his wife and
babe, with whom I made genial acquaintance.&nbsp; I asked the
wife the name for a whip; she replied <i>B&rsquo;meergashee</i>;
a pony was <i>shoonga</i>, the nose <i>hin</i>, and a woman
<i>shimmy-shindy</i>!&nbsp; I bought his whip for a dollar.&nbsp;
The squaw generously offered to throw in the baby, which I
declined, and we all laughed and parted.</p>
<p>I went to the camp, and there the whole party, seeing my
curious whip, went at the Kaws to buy theirs.&nbsp; Bank-bills
were our only currency then, and the Indians knew there were such
things as counterfeits.&nbsp; They consulted together, eyed us
carefully, and then every man as he received his dollar brought
it to me for approval.&nbsp; By chance I knew the Pawnee word for
&ldquo;good&rdquo; (<i>Washitaw</i>), and they also knew
it.&nbsp; Then came a strange wild scene.&nbsp; I spoke to the
chief, and pointing to my whip said,
&ldquo;<i>B&rsquo;meergashee</i>&rdquo; and indicating a woman
and a pony, repeated, &ldquo;<i>Shimmy-shindy</i>,
<i>shoonga-hin</i>,&rdquo; intimating that its use was to
chastise women and ponies by hitting them on the nose.&nbsp;
Great was the amazement and delight of the Kaws, who roared with
laughter, and their chief curiously inquired, &ldquo;<i>You</i>
Kaw?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I replied, &ldquo;<i>O</i>,
<i>nitchee</i>, <i>me</i> Kaw, <i>washit&aacute;</i> good Injun
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He at once embraced me with frantic joy, as did
the others, to the great amazement of my friends.&nbsp; A wild
circular dance was at once improvised to celebrate my reception
into the tribe; at which <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>our driver
Brigham dryly remarked that he didn&rsquo;t wonder they were glad
to get me, for I was the first Injun ever seen in that tribe with
a whole shirt on him.&nbsp; This was the order of
proceedings:&mdash;I stood in the centre and sang wildly the
following song, which was a great favourite with our party, and
all joining in the chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I slew the chief of the Muscolgee;<br />
I burnt his squaw at the blasted tree!<br />
By the hind-legs I tied up the cur,<br />
He had no time to fondle on her.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i>.</p>
<p>Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!<br />
Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!</p>
<p>A faggot from the blasted tree<br />
Fired the lodge of the Muscolgee;<br />
His sinews served to string my bow<br />
When bent to lay his brethren low.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i>.</p>
<p>Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!<br />
Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!</p>
<p>I stripped his skull all naked and bare,<br />
And here&rsquo;s his skull with a tuft of hair!<br />
His heart is in the eagle&rsquo;s maw,<br />
His bloody bones the wolf doth gnaw.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i>.</p>
<p>Hoo! hoo! hoo! the Muscolgee!<br />
Wah, wah, wah! the blasted tree!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Indians yelled and drummed at the Reception Dance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now you good Kaw&mdash;Good Injun you be&mdash;all same
me,&rdquo; said the chief.&nbsp; Hassard and Lamborn cracked time
with their whips, and, in short, we made a grand circular row;
truly it was a wondrous striking scene!&nbsp; From that day I was
called the Kaw chief, even by Hassard in his letters to the
<i>Tribune</i>, in which he mentioned that in scenes of
excitement I rode and whooped like a savage.&nbsp; It <i>may</i>
be so&mdash;<i>I</i> never noticed it; perhaps he exaggerated,
but I must admit that I do like <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Indians,
and they like me.&nbsp; We took ambulances or strong covered
army-waggons and pushed on.&nbsp; We were now well out on the
plains.&nbsp; All day long we passed prairie-dog villages and saw
antelopes bounding afar.&nbsp; At night we stopped at the hotel
<i>Alla Fresca</i>, or slept in the open air.&nbsp; It was
perfectly delightful, though in November.&nbsp; Far in the
distance many prairie fires stretched like miles of blazing
serpents over the distance.&nbsp; I thought of the innumerable
camp-fires before the battle of Gettysburg, and determined that
the two were among the most wonderful sights of my life.&nbsp; We
rose very early in the morning, by grey light, and after a drink
of whisky pushed on.&nbsp; I may here mention that from 1863 for
six years I very rarely indeed tasted any intoxicant.</p>
<p>So we went on till we reached the last surveyor&rsquo;s
camp.&nbsp; We had not been there half an hour before a man came
in declaring that he had just saved his scalp, having seen a
party of Apaches in their war-paint, but luckily hid himself
before they discovered him.&nbsp; It was evident that we had now
got beyond civilisation.&nbsp; Already, on the way, we had seen
ranches which had been recently burned by the Indians, who had
killed their inmates.&nbsp; One man, observing my Kaw whip,
casually remarked that as I was fond of curiosities he was sorry
that he had not kept six arrows which he had lately pulled out of
a man whom he had found lying dead in the road, and who had just
been shot by the Indians.</p>
<p>Within this same hour after our arrival there came in a
Lieutenant Hesselberger, bringing with him a Mrs. Box and her two
daughters, one about sixteen and the other twelve.&nbsp; The
Indians had on the Texas frontier murdered and scalped her
husband before her eyes, burned their home, and carried the three
into captivity, where for six months they were daily subjected to
such <i>incredible</i> outrages and cruelty that it was simply a
miracle that they survived.&nbsp; As it was, they looked exactly
like corpses.&nbsp; Lieutenant Hesselberger, with bravery beyond
belief, having heard of these captives, went alone to the Indians
to ransom them.&nbsp; Firstly, they fired guns unexpectedly <!--
page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>close to his head, and finding that he did not start,
brought out the captives and subjected them to the extremes of
gross abuse before his eyes, and repeatedly knocked them down
with clubs, all of which he affected to disregard.&nbsp; At last
the price was agreed on and he took them away.</p>
<p>In after years, when I described all this in London to
Stanley, the African explorer, he said, &ldquo;Strange!&nbsp; I,
too, was there that very day, and saw those women, and wrote an
account of it to the <i>New York Herald</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
daresay that I met and talked to him at the time among those whom
we saw.</p>
<p>Not far from our camp there was a large and well-populated
beaver-dam, which I studied with great interest.&nbsp; It was
more like a well regulated town than is many a western mining
village.&nbsp; I do not wonder that Indians regard
<i>Quahbeet</i>, the beaver, as a human being in disguise.&nbsp;
N.B.&mdash;The beaver always, when he cuts a stick, sharpens it
like a lead-pencil&mdash;which indicates an artistic nature.</p>
<p>It was now resolved that a number of our party should go into
the Smoky Hill country to attend a very great Indian council,
while the rest returned home.&nbsp; So I joined the
adventurers.&nbsp; The meeting was not held, for I believe the
Indians went to war.&nbsp; But we rode on.&nbsp; One morning I
saw afar a few black specks, and thought they were cattle.&nbsp;
And so they were, but the free cattle of the plains, or
buffaloes.&nbsp; That evening, as we were out of meat, Colton and
others went out to hunt them, and had a fine chase, but got
nothing.</p>
<p>The next morning Colton kindly gave me his chance&mdash;that
is, he resigned to me a splendid black horse used to the
business&mdash;and most of us went to the field.&nbsp; After a
while, or a four miles&rsquo; run, we came up with a
number.&nbsp; There was a fine cow singled out and shot at, and I
succeeded in putting a ball in just behind the shoulder.&nbsp;
Among us all she became beef, and an expert hunter with us, whose
business it was to supply the camp with meat, skinned and
butchered her and <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>cooked a meal for us on the
spot.&nbsp; The beef was deliciously tender and well
flavoured.</p>
<p>Now, before this cooking, in the excitement of the chase, I
had ridden on like an Indian, as Hassard said in his letter,
whooping like one all alone after the buffalo, and in my joy
forgot to shake the spent cartridge out of my Spenser
seven-shooter carbine.&nbsp; All at once I found myself right in
the herd, close by a monstrous bull, whose height at the instant
when he turned on me to gore me seemed to be about a hundred and
fifty feet.&nbsp; But my horse was used to this, and swerved with
incredible tact and swiftness, while I held on.&nbsp; I then had
a perfectly close shot, not six feet off, under the shoulder, and
I raised the carbine and pulled trigger, when
it&mdash;<i>ticked</i>!&nbsp; I had forgotten the dead cartridge,
and was not used to the arm which I carried.&nbsp; I think that I
swore, and if I did not I am sorry for it.&nbsp; Before I could
arrange my charge the buffaloes were far away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p329b.jpg">
<img alt="Stairs of rock" src="images/p329s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>However, we had got our cow, and that was more than we really
needed.&nbsp; At any rate, I had shot a buffalo and had a
stupendous run.&nbsp; And here I must mention that while racing
and whooping, I executed the most insanely foolish thing I ever
did in all my life, which astonished the hunter and all present
to the utmost.&nbsp; I was at the top of a declivity <!-- page
330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>from which there descended a flight of natural stairs
of rock, but every one very broad, like the above sketch.</p>
<p>And being inspired by the devil, and my horse not objecting at
all, I clattered down over it at full speed <i>&agrave; la</i>
Putnam.&nbsp; I have heard that Indians do this very boldly,
declaring that it is perfectly safe if the rider is not afraid,
and I am quite sure that mine must have been an Indian
horse.&nbsp; I hope that no one will think that I have put
forward or made too much of these trifling boyish tricks of
recklessness.&nbsp; They are of daily occurrence in the Wild West
among men who like excitement, and had Robert Hunt been among us
there would have been fun indeed.</p>
<p>So we turned homewards, for the Indian Conference had proved a
failure.&nbsp; We had for our driver a man named Brigham, to whom
I had taken a great liking.&nbsp; He had lived as a trader among
the wildest Indians, spoke Spanish fluently, and knew the whole
Western frontier like his pocket.&nbsp; The day after we had seen
Mrs. Box come in, I was praising the braveness of Lieutenant
Hesselberger in venturing to rescue her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t all bravery at all,&rdquo; said
Brigham.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s brave as a panther, but
there&rsquo;s more in it than <i>that</i>.&nbsp; There is about
one man in a hundred, and not more, who can go among the most
God-forsaken devils of Injuns and never get hurt.&nbsp; The
Injuns take to them at a glance and love &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> such a man, and I&rsquo;ve proved it often
enough, God knows!&nbsp; Lieutenant Hesselberger is one,
and,&rdquo; he added abruptly, &ldquo;Mr. Leland,
<i>you&rsquo;re</i> another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; I said, greatly
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ve watched you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
got Injun ways that you don&rsquo;t know of.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I
notice the other day, when the gentlemen were buying the whips
from the Kaws, that every Injun took a squint, and then came
straight to <i>you</i>?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t they go to one of
the other gentlemen?&nbsp; Because they&rsquo;ve got an instinct
like a dog for their friends, and for such as
<i>we</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>We were coming to Fort Harker.&nbsp; I forget how it
all came about, but we found ourselves afoot, with a mile or two
to walk, carrying our guns, carpet-bags, and <i>petites
bagages</i>, while about fifty yards ahead or more there was
Brigham driving on merrily to the fort, under the impression that
we had secured other conveyance.</p>
<p>Captain Colton fired his carbine.&nbsp; It made about as much
noise as a percussion-cap, and the wind was from Brigham toward
us.&nbsp; Carried away by an impulse, I caught Colonel
Lamborn&rsquo;s light rifle out of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean
to shoot at him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll insure the mules,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I will the driver.&rdquo;&nbsp; My calculation was to send
a bullet so near to Brigham that he could hear it whizz, but not
to touch him.&nbsp; It was not so dangerous as the shot I had
fired over Sam Fox, and the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; was on me!</p>
<p>But I did <i>not</i> know that in the covered waggon sat
Hassard talking with Brigham, their faces being, as Hassard
declared, just about six inches apart.&nbsp; I fired, and the
bullet passed just between their noses!</p>
<p>Hassard heard the whizz, and cried, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Injuns</i>, by God!&rdquo; roared Brigham,
forgetting that we had left the Indian country two days behind
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lie down in the waggon while I
drive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And drive he did, till out of gunshot, and
then putting his face out, turned around, and gave in full
desperate cry the taunting war-whoop of the Cheyennes.&nbsp; It
was a beautiful sight that of Brigham&rsquo;s broad red face wild
with rage&mdash;and his great gold earrings and Mexican
sombrero&mdash;turning round the waggon at us in defiance like
Marmion!</p>
<p>But when he realised that <i>we</i> had fired at him, just as
a pack of d---d Apaches might have done, for fun, to stop the
waggon, his expression became one of utter bewilderment.&nbsp; As
I came up I thought there might be a shindy.</p>
<p><!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>&ldquo;Brigham,&rdquo; I said in Spanish, &ldquo;<i>es
la mano o el navajo</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; [Is it to be hand, or
knife?]</p>
<p>Brigham was proud of his Spanish; it was his elegant
accomplishment, and this was a good scene.&nbsp; Grasping my hand
cordially, he said, &ldquo;<i>La mano</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like a
true frontiersman, he felt in a minute the <i>grandeur</i> of the
joke.&nbsp; There was, if I may so vulgarly express myself, an
<i>Indian-uity</i> in it which appealed to his deepest
feelings.&nbsp; There was a silence for several minutes, which he
broke by exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve driven waggons now this twelve years on the
frontier, but I never heard before of tryin&rsquo; to stop the
waggon by shootin&rsquo; at the driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another long silent pause, when he
resumed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to God there was a gulch (ravine) between here
and the fort!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d upset this crowd into it d---d
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening I took leave of Brigham.&nbsp; I drank healths
with him in whisky, and shook hands, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did a very foolish and reckless thing to-day,
Brigham, when I shot at you, and I am sorry for it, and I beg
your pardon.&nbsp; Here is a dagger which I have had for
twenty-five years.&nbsp; I carried it all over Europe.&nbsp; I
have nothing better to give you; please take it.&nbsp; And when
you stick a Greaser (Mexican) with it, as I expect you will do
some day, then think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears rose to his eyes, and he departed.&nbsp; I never met
him again, but &ldquo;well I wot&rdquo; he ever had kindly
remembrance of me.&nbsp; We were to be guests of General Custer
at the fort, and I was rather shy of meeting the castellan after
firing at his driver!&nbsp; But he greeted me with a hearty burst
of laughter, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Leland, you have the most original way of ringing a
bell when you want to call a carriage that I ever heard
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Hassard, when he witnessed my parting with Brigham, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all mighty fine! daggers and whisky, and all
<!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>kinds of beautiful things flying around for Brigham,
but what am <i>I</i> to have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what dost thou expect, son Hassard?&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>Holding out both his hands, he replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much tobacco! much tobacco!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was in allusion to a story told us by Lieutenant
Brown.&nbsp; Not long before, the Lieutenant, seeing, as he
thought, a buffalo, had fired at it.&nbsp; But the buffalo turned
out to be an Indian on a pony; and the Indian riding fiercely at
the Lieutenant, cried aloud for indemnity or the
&ldquo;blood-fine&rdquo; in the words, &ldquo;Much
tobacco!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so I stood cigars.</p>
<p>Life is worth living for&mdash;or it would be&mdash;if it
abounded more in such types as Mrs. General Custer and her
husband.&nbsp; There was a bright and joyous chivalry in that
man, and a noble refinement mingled with constant gaiety in the
wife, such as I fear is passing from the earth.&nbsp; Her books
have shown that she was a woman of true culture, and that she
came by it easily, as he did, and that out of a little they could
make more than most do from a life of mere study.&nbsp; I fear
that there will come a time when such books as hers will be the
only evidences that there were ever such people&mdash;so
fearless, so familiar with every form of danger, privation, and
trial, and yet joyous and even reckless of it all.&nbsp; Good
Southern blood and Western experiences had made them free of
petty troubles.&nbsp; The Indians got his scalp at last, and with
him went one of the noblest men whom America ever brought forth.
<a name="citation333"></a><a href="#footnote333"
class="citation">[333]</a></p>
<p>That evening they sent for a Bavarian-Tyroler soldier, who
played beautifully on the cithern.&nbsp; As I listened to the
<i>Jodel-lieder</i> airs I seemed to be again in his native
land.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to me to hear from him the familiar
dialect.</p>
<p><!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>At St. Louis we were very kindly entertained in several
distinguished houses.&nbsp; At one they gave us some excellent
Rhine wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; said Hassard, who was
a good Latinist.</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Vinum Rhenense decus et gloria
mense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next we had Moselle wine.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what of
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;Vinuin Moslanum fuit omne tempore
sanum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here I would say that every memory which I have of
Missouri (and there are more by far than this book indicates), as
of Missourians, is extremely pleasant.&nbsp; The State is very
beautiful, and I have found among my friends there born such
culture and kindness and genial hospitality as I have never seen
surpassed.&nbsp; To the names of Mary A. Owen, <a
name="citation334"></a><a href="#footnote334"
class="citation">[334]</a>&nbsp; Blow, Mark Twain, and the
Choteaus I could add many more.</p>
<p>So we jogged on homeward.&nbsp; I resumed my work.&nbsp; I had
written out all the details of our trip in letters to the
<i>Press</i>.&nbsp; They had excited attention.&nbsp; The
Pennsylvania Railroad Company suggested that they should be
published in a pamphlet.&nbsp; I did so, and called it
&ldquo;Three Thousand Miles in a Railroad Car.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
offered to pay me a very good sum for my trouble in so
doing.&nbsp; I declined it, because I felt that I had been amply
paid by the pleasure which I had derived from the journey.&nbsp;
But I received grateful recognition subsequently in another
form.&nbsp; The pamphlet was most singular of its kind.&nbsp; It
was a full report of all the statistics and vast advantages of
the Kansas Pacific Road.&nbsp; It contained very valuable facts
and figures; and it was all served up with jokes, songs,
buffalo-hunting, Indians, and Brigham.&nbsp; It was a marvellous
farrago, and it &ldquo;took.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was sent to every
member of Congress and &ldquo;every other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>Before it appeared, a friend of mine named Ringwalt,
who was both a literary man and owner of a printing-office,
offered me $200 if I would secure him the printing of it.&nbsp; I
said that I would not take the money, but that I would get him
the printing, which I easily did; but being a very honourable
man, he was led to discharge the obligation.&nbsp; One day he
said to me, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you publish your
&lsquo;Breitmann Ballads?&rsquo;&nbsp; Everybody is quoting them
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;There is not a publisher in
America who would accept them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I was quite
right, for there was not.&nbsp; He answered, &ldquo;I will print
them for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I accepted the offer, but when they
were set up an idea occurred to me by which I could save my
friend his expenses.&nbsp; I went to a publisher named T. B.
Peterson, who said effectively this&mdash;&ldquo;The book will
not sell more than a thousand copies.&nbsp; There will be about a
thousand people who will buy it, even for fifty cents, so I shall
charge that, though it would be, as books go, only as a
twenty-five cent work.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took it and paid my friend
for the composition.&nbsp; I was not to receive any money or
share in the profits till all the expenses had been paid.</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson immediately sold 2,000&mdash;4,000&mdash;I know
not how many thousands&mdash;at fifty cents a copy.&nbsp; It was
republished in Canada and Australia, to my loss.&nbsp; An
American publisher who owned a magazine asked me, through his
editor, to write for it a long Breitmann poem.&nbsp; I did so,
making, however, an explicit verbal arrangement <i>that it should
not be republished as a book</i>.&nbsp; It was, however,
immediately republished as such, with a title to the effect that
it was the &ldquo;Breitmann Ballads.&rdquo;&nbsp; I appealed to
the editor, and it was withdrawn, but I know not how many were
issued, to my loss.</p>
<p>I had transferred the whole right of publication in England to
my friend Nicolas Tr&uuml;bner, whom I had met when he had
visited America, and I wrote specially for his edition certain
poems.&nbsp; John &ldquo;Camden&rdquo; Hotten wrote to me
modestly asking me to give <i>him</i> the sole right to republish
the work.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I hardly know what to say about
the price.&nbsp; <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>Suppose we say <i>ten
pounds</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;Sir, I have given the
whole right of publication to Mr. Tr&uuml;bner, and I would not
take it from him for ten thousand pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hotten at
once published an edition which was a curiosity of ignorance and
folly.&nbsp; There was a blunder on an average to every
page.&nbsp; He had annotated it!&nbsp; He explained that
<i>Knasterbart</i> meant &ldquo;a nasty fellow,&rdquo; and that
the French <i>garce</i> was <i>gare</i>, &ldquo;a railway
station!&rdquo;&nbsp; Tr&uuml;bner had sold 5,000 copies before
this precious affair appeared.&nbsp; After Hotten&rsquo;s death
the British public were informed in an obituary that he had
&ldquo;<i>first</i> introduced me&rdquo; to their knowledge!</p>
<p>Hans Breitmann became a type.&nbsp; I never heard of but one
German who ever reviled the book, and that was a Democratic
editor in Philadelphia.&nbsp; But the Germans themselves
recognised that the pen which poked fun at them was no poisoned
stiletto.&nbsp; Whenever there was a grand German procession,
Hans was in it&mdash;the indomitable old <i>Degen</i> hung with
<i>loot</i>&mdash;and he appeared in every fancy ball.&nbsp; Nor
were the Confederates offended.&nbsp; One of the most genial,
searching, and erudite reviews of the work, which appeared in a
Southern magazine (De Bow&rsquo;s), declared that I had truly
written the Hudibras of the Civil War.&nbsp; What struck this
writer most was the fact that I had opened a <i>new</i> field of
humour.&nbsp; And here he was quite right.&nbsp; With the
exception of Dan Rice&rsquo;s circus song of &ldquo;Der goot oldt
Sherman shentleman,&rdquo; and a rather flat parody of
&ldquo;Jessie, the Flower of Dumblane,&rdquo; I had never seen or
heard of any specimen of Anglo-German poetry.&nbsp; To be
<i>merely original</i> in language is not to excel in
everything&mdash;a fact very generally ignored&mdash;else my
Pidgin-English ballads would take precedence of Tennyson&rsquo;s
poems!&nbsp; On the other hand, very great poets have often not
made a new <i>form</i>.&nbsp; The Yankee type, both as regards
spirit and language, had become completely common and familiar in
prose and poetry, before Lowell revived it in the clever
<i>Biglow Papers</i>.&nbsp; Bret Harte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heathen
Chinee,&rdquo; and several other poems, are, however, <i>both</i>
original <!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 337</span>and admirable.&nbsp; Whatever the
merits or demerits of mine were&mdash;and it was years ere I ever
gave them a thought&mdash;the public, which is always eager for
something new, took to them at once.</p>
<p>I say that for years I never gave them a thought.&nbsp; All of
the principal poems except the &ldquo;Barty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Breitmann as a Politician,&rdquo; were merely written to
fill up letters to C. A. Bristed, of New York, and I kept no
copies of them&mdash;in fact, utterly <i>forgot</i> them.&nbsp;
<i>Weingeist</i> was first written in a letter to a sister of
Captain Colton, with the remark that it was easier to write such
a ballad than any prose.&nbsp; But Bristed published them
<i>&agrave; mon insu</i> in a sporting paper.&nbsp; Years after I
learned that I published one called &ldquo;Breitmann&rsquo;s
Sermon&rdquo; in <i>Leslie&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.&nbsp; This I
have never recovered.&nbsp; If I write so much about these poems
now, I certainly was not vain of them when written.&nbsp; The
public found them out long before I did, and it is not very often
that it gets ahead of a poet in appreciating his own works.</p>
<p>However, I was &ldquo;awful busy&rdquo; in those days.&nbsp; I
had hardly begun on the <i>Press</i> ere I found that it had a
weekly paper, made up from the daily type transferred, which only
just paid its expenses.&nbsp; Secondly, I discovered that there
was not a soul on the staff except myself who had had any
experience of weekly full editing.&nbsp; I at once made out a
schedule, showing that by collecting and grouping agricultural
and industrial items, putting in two or three columns of original
matter, and bringing in a story to go through the daily first,
the weekly could be vastly improved at very little expense.</p>
<p>Colonel Forney admired the scheme, but asked &ldquo;who was to
carry it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied that I would.&nbsp; He
remonstrated, very kindly, urging that I had all I could do as it
was.&nbsp; I answered, &ldquo;Colonel Forney, this is not a
matter of time, but <i>method</i>.&nbsp; There is always time for
the man who knows how to lay it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I got up a
very nice paper.&nbsp; But for a very long time I could not get
an agent to solicit advertisements <!-- page 338--><a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>who knew
the business.&nbsp; The weekly paid its expenses and nothing
more.&nbsp; But one day there came to me a young man named M. T.
Wolf.&nbsp; He was of Pennsylvania German stock.&nbsp; He had
lost a small fortune in the patent medicine business and wanted
employment badly.&nbsp; I suggested that, until something else
could be found, he should try his hand at collecting
&ldquo;advers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, be it observed, as Mozart was born to music, and some men
have a powerful instinct to study medicine, and others are so
unnatural as to take to mathematics, Wolf had a grand undeveloped
genius beyond all belief for collecting advertisements.&nbsp; He
had tried many pursuits and failed, but the first week he went
into this business he brought in $200 (&pound;40), which gave him
forty dollars, and he never afterwards fell below it, but often
rose above.&nbsp; &ldquo;Advers.&rdquo; for him meant not
adversity.&nbsp; It was very characteristic of Colonel Forney,
who was too much absorbed in politics to attend much to business,
that long after the <i>Weekly Press</i> was yielding him $10,000
a year <i>clear profit</i>, he said to me one day, &ldquo;Mr.
Leland, you must not be discouraged as to the weekly; the clerks
tell me in the office that it <i>meets its
expenses</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was abundance of life and incident on the newspaper in
those days, especially during election times in the autumn.&nbsp;
I have known fights, night after night, to be going on in the
street below, at the corner of Seventh and Chestnut, between
Republicans and Democrats, with revolver shots and flashes at the
rate of fifty to a second, when I was literally so occupied with
pressing telegrams that I could not look out to see the
fun.&nbsp; One night, however, when there were death-shots
falling thick and fast, I saw a young man make a most
<i>incredible</i> leap.&nbsp; He had received a bullet under the
shoulder, and when a man or a deer is hit there he always
leaps.&nbsp; I heard afterwards that he recovered, though this is
a vital place.</p>
<p>It happened once that for a week the Republicans were kept
from resisting or retaliating by their leaders, until the <!--
page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>Democrats began to disgrace themselves by
excesses.&nbsp; Then all at once the Republicans boiled over,
thrashed their foes, and attacking the Copperhead clubs, threw
their furniture out of the window, and&mdash;inadvertently
perhaps&mdash;also a few Copperheads.&nbsp; Just before they let
their angry passions rise in this fashion there came one night a
delegation to serenade Colonel Forney at the office.&nbsp; The
Colonel was grand on such occasions.&nbsp; He was a fine, tall,
portly man, with a lion-like mien and a powerful voice.&nbsp; He
began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, fellow-citizens and Republicans, you have
this week acted nobly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cries from the crowd, &ldquo;<i>We hev</i>! <i>we
hev</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, when smitten on the right cheek, turned unto the
oppressor the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did! we <i>did</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are beyond all question models&mdash;I may say with
truth, paragons of patience, long-suffering, and humility.&nbsp;
You are&mdash;Christian gentlemen!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We air! we
<i>air</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was passing, a great gloomy thundercloud of the
Democratic enemy gathered on the opposite sidewalk, and as the
Colonel lifted his voice again, there came a cry&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you d---d old Republican dead-duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That word was a spell to raise the devil withal.&nbsp; Bang!
bang! bang! went the revolvers of the Union men in a volley, and
the Democrats fled for their lives down Seventh Street, pursued
by the meek, lowly, and long-suffering Christians&mdash;like
rabbits before wolves.</p>
<p>The enemy at last resolved to attack the <i>Press</i> and burn
the building.&nbsp; Then we had one hundred and fifty policemen
sent to garrison and guard.&nbsp; There was a surging, howling
mob outside, and much guerilla-shooting, but all I can remember
is my vexation at having so much to disturb me in making up the
paper.</p>
<p>I never went armed in my life when I could help it, for I <!--
page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>hate <i>impedimenta</i> in my pockets.&nbsp; All of us
in the office hung up our coats in a dark place outside.&nbsp;
Whenever I sent an assistant to get some papers from mine, he
said that he always knew my coat because there was no pistol in
it.</p>
<p>Scenes such as these, and quite as amusing, were of constant
occurrence in those days in Philadelphia.&nbsp; &ldquo;All night
long in that sweet little village was heard the soft note of the
pistol and the dying scream of the victim.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, be
it noted, that a stuffed dead duck had become the <i>gonfalon</i>
or banner of the Republicans, and where it swung there the battle
was fiercest.&nbsp; There was a young fellow from South Carolina,
who had become a zealous Union man, and who made up for a sinful
lack of sense by a stupendous stock of courage.&nbsp; One morning
there came into the office an object&mdash;and such an
object!&nbsp; His face was all swathed and hidden in bloody
bandages; he was tattered, and limped, and had his arm in a
sling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, who and what are you?&rdquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who has been passing you through a
bark-mill that you look so ground-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a sepulchral voice he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ---, and
last night <i>I carried the dead duck</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Till I came on the <i>Press</i> there was, it may be said,
almost no community between the Germans of North Philadelphia and
the Americans in our line.&nbsp; But I had become intimate with
Von Tronk, a Hanoverian of good family, a lawyer, and editor, I
believe, of the <i>Freie Presse</i>.&nbsp; I even went once or
twice to speak at German meetings.&nbsp; In fact, I was getting
to be considered &ldquo;almost as all de same so goot ash
Deutsch,&rdquo; and very &ldquo;bopular.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day Von
Tronk came with a request.&nbsp; There was to be an immense
German Republican <i>Massenversammlung</i> or mass-meeting in a
great beer-garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Colonel Forney could only be
induced to address them!&rdquo;&nbsp; I undertook to do it.&nbsp;
It was an entirely new field to him, but one wondrous rich in
votes.&nbsp; Now Colonel Forney, though from Lancaster County and
of German-Swiss extraction, <!-- page 341--><a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>knew not a
word of the language, and I undertook to coach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will only need one phrase of three words,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;to pull you through; but you must pronounce them
perfectly and easily.&nbsp; They are <i>Freiheit und
Gleichheit</i>, &lsquo;freedom and equality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, if
you <i>please</i>, <i>fry-height</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel went at his lesson, and being naturally clever,
with a fine, deep voice, in a quarter of an hour could roar out
<i>Freiheit und Gleichheit</i> with an intonation which would
have raised a revolution in Berlin.&nbsp; We came to the garden,
and there was an immense sensation.&nbsp; The Colonel had winning
manners, with a manly mien, and he was duly introduced.&nbsp;
When he rose to speak there was dead silence.&nbsp; He
began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends and German Fellow-citizens:&mdash;Yet why
should I distinguish the words, since to me every German is a
friend.&nbsp; I am myself, as you all know, of unmingled German
extraction, and I am very, very proud of it.&nbsp; But there is
one German sentiment which from a child has been ever in my
heart, and from infancy ever on my lips, and that sentiment, my
friends, is <i>Freiheit und Gleichheit</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever audience was astonished in this world it was that of
the <i>Massenversammlung</i> when this burst on their ears.&nbsp;
They hurrahed and roared and banged the tables in such a mad
storm of delight as even Colonel Forney had never seen
surpassed.&nbsp; Rising to the occasion, he thundered on, and as
he reached the end of every sentence he repeated, with great
skill and aptness, <i>Freiheit und Gleichheit</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made two thousand votes by that speech,
Colonel,&rdquo; I said, as we returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Von Tronk
will manage it at this crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp; After that, when the
Colonel jested, he would called me &ldquo;the Dutch
vote-maker.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was during the Grant campaign.</p>
<p>Droll incidents were of constant occurrence in this
life.&nbsp; Out of a myriad I will note a few.&nbsp; One day
there came into our office an Indian agent from the West, who had
brought <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>with him a Winnebago who claimed to
be the rightful chief of his tribe.&nbsp; They were going to
Washington to enforce the claim.&nbsp; While the agent conversed
with some one the Indian was turned over to me.&nbsp; He was a
magnificent specimen, six feet high, clad in a long trailing
scarlet blanket, with a scarlet straight feather in his hair
which continued him up <i>ad infinitum</i>, and he was straight
as a lightning rod.&nbsp; He was handsome, and very dignified and
grave; but I understood <i>that</i>.&nbsp; I can come it
indifferent well myself when I am &ldquo;out of my plate,&rdquo;
as the French, say, in strange society.&nbsp; He spoke no
English, but, as the agent said, knew six Indian languages.&nbsp;
He was evidently a chief by blood, &ldquo;all the way down to his
moccasins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What with a few words of Kaw (I had learned about a hundred
words of it with great labour) and a few other phrases of other
tongues, I succeeded in interesting him.&nbsp; But I could not
make him smile, and I swore unto myself that I would.</p>
<p>Being thirsty, the Indian, seeing a cooler of ice-water, with
the daring peculiar to a great brave, went and took a glass and
turned on the <i>spicket</i>.&nbsp; He filled his glass&mdash;it
was brim-full&mdash;but he did not know how to <i>turn it
off</i>.&nbsp; Then I had him.&nbsp; As it ran over he turned to
me an appealing helpless glance.&nbsp; I said
&ldquo;<i>Neosho</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This in Pottawattamie means an
inundation or overflowing of the banks, and is generally applied
to the inundation of the Mississippi.&nbsp; There is a town on
the latter so called.&nbsp; This was too much for the Indian, and
he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God! what have you been saying to that
Indian?&rdquo; cried the agent, amazed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the
first time he has laughed since he left home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little pun in Pottawattamie.&nbsp; But I really
know very little of the language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no knowledge of the Indian languages,&rdquo;
remarked our city editor, MacGinnis, a genial young Irishman,
&ldquo;least of all, thank God! of Pottawattamie.&nbsp; But I
have always <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>understood that when a man gets so
far in a tongue as to make <i>puns</i> in it, it is time for him
to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years after this I was one evening in London at an opening of
an exhibition of pictures.&nbsp; There were present Indian Hindoo
princes in gorgeous array, English nobility, literary men, and
fine ladies.&nbsp; Among them was an unmistakable Chippeway in a
white Canadian blanket-coat, every inch an Indian.&nbsp; I began
with the usual greeting, &ldquo;<i>Ho nitchi</i>!&rdquo; (Ho,
brother!), to which he gravely replied.&nbsp; I tried two or
three phrases on him with the same effect.&nbsp; Then I played a
sure card.&nbsp; Sinking my voice with an inviting wink, I
uttered &ldquo;<i>Shingawauba</i>,&rdquo; or whisky.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dot fetched him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He too laughed.&nbsp;
<i>Gleich mit gleich</i>, <i>gesellt sich gern</i>.</p>
<p>While living in New York, and during my connection with the
<i>Press</i>, I often met and sometimes conversed with Horace
Greeley.&nbsp; Once I went with him from Philadelphia to New
York, and he was in the car the observed of all observers to an
extraordinary degree.&nbsp; He sat down, took out an immense roll
of proof, and said, &ldquo;<i>Lead pencil</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; One
was immediately handed to him by some stranger, who was by that
one act ennobled, or, what amounts to the same thing in America,
grotesquely <i>charactered</i> for life.&nbsp; He was the man who
gave Horace Greeley a lead pencil!&nbsp; I, as his companion, was
also regarded as above ordinary humanity.&nbsp; When the proof
was finished &ldquo;Horace&rdquo; said to me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is John Forney getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Satan, walking to and fro upon the face of the
earth, going from the <i>Chronicle</i> in Washington one day to
the <i>Press</i> in Philadelphia on the next, and filling them
both cram full of leaders and letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two papers, both daily!&nbsp; I tell Forney that I find
it is all I can do to attend to one.&nbsp; Tell him not to get
too rich&mdash;bad for the constitution and worse for the
country.&nbsp; Any man who has more than a million is a public
nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, we walked together from the ferry to the corner of
Park Place and Broadway, and the philosopher, after <!-- page

344</span>minutely explaining to me which omnibus I was to take,
bade me adieu.&nbsp; I do not think we ever met again.</p>
<p>In the summer Colonel Forney went to Europe with John the
junior.&nbsp; When he left he said, &ldquo;I do not expect you to
raise the circulation of the <i>Press</i>, but I hope that you
will be able to keep it from falling in the dead
season.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went to work, and what with enlarging the
telegraphic news, and correspondence, and full reports of
conventions, I materially increased the sale.&nbsp; It cost a
great deal of money, to be sure, but the Colonel did not mind
that.&nbsp; At this time there came into our office as associate
with me Captain W. W. Nevin.&nbsp; He had been all through the
war.&nbsp; I took a great liking to him, and we always remained
intimate friends.&nbsp; All in our office except myself were from
Lancaster County, the birthplace, I believe, of Fitch and
Fulton.&nbsp; It is a Pennsylvania German county, and as I
notoriously spoke German openly without shame ours was called a
Dutch office.&nbsp; Once when Colonel Forney wrote a letter from
Holland describing the windmills, the <i>Sunday Transcript</i>
unkindly remarked that &ldquo;he had better come home and look
after his own Dutch windmill at the corner of Seventh and
Chestnut Streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had at this time a great deal to do with the operas and
theatres, and often wrote the reviews.&nbsp; After a while, as
Captain Nevin relieved me of a great deal of work, and I had an
able assistant named Norcross, I devoted myself chiefly to
dramatic criticism and the weekly, and such work as suited me
best.&nbsp; As for the dignity of managership, Captain Nevin and
I tossed it from one to the other like a hot potato in jest, but
between us we ran the paper very well.&nbsp; There was an opera
impresario named Maurice Strakosch, of whom I had heard that he
was hard to deal with and irritable.&nbsp; I forget now who the
prima donna in his charge was, but there had appeared in our
paper a criticism which might be interpreted in some detail
unfavourably by a captious critic.&nbsp; One afternoon there came
into the office, where I was alone, a gentlemanly-seeming man,
who began to manifest anger in regard <!-- page 345--><a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>to the
criticism in question.&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;I do not know,
sir, what your position in the opera troupe may be, but if it be
anything which requires a knowledge of English, I am afraid that
you are misplaced.&nbsp; There was no intention to offend in the
remarks, and so far as the lady is concerned I shall only be too
glad to say the very best I can of her.&nbsp; <i>Comprenez</i>,
<i>monsieur</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est une bagatelle</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He laughed, and we spoke French, then Italian, then German, and
of Patti and Sontag and Lind.&nbsp; Then I asked him what he
really was, and he replied, &ldquo;I do not believe that you even
know the name of my native tongue.&nbsp; It is
Czech.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stared at him amazed, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veliky Bog!&nbsp; Rozprava pochesky?&nbsp; Nekrasneya
rejece est.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bohemian gentleman drew a handsomely bound book from his
pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is my
album.&nbsp; It is full of signatures of great artists, even of
kings and queens and poets.&nbsp; There is not a name in it which
is not that of a distinguished person, and I do not know what
your name is, but I beg that you will write it in my
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly the same scene was repeated soon after, with the same
words, when the great actress Fanny Janauschek came to
Philadelphia.&nbsp; At that time she played only in German.&nbsp;
Her manager, Grau, introduced me to her, and she complimented me
on my German, and praised the language as the finest in the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> certainly
very fine.&nbsp; But I know a finer, which goes more nearly to
the heart, and with which I can move you more deeply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; cried the great artist
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; I replied, in her native tongue,
&ldquo;<i>Bohemian</i>.&nbsp; That is the language for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Janauschek was so affected that she burst out crying,
though she was a woman of tremendous nerve.&nbsp; We became great
friends, and often met again in after years in England.</p>
<p><!-- page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>I have seen Ristori play for thirty nights in
succession, <a name="citation346"></a><a href="#footnote346"
class="citation">[346]</a> and Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt; but as
regards true genius, Janauschek in her earlier days was
incomparably their superior; for these all played from nerves and
instinct, but Janauschek from her brain and intellect.&nbsp; I
often wondered that she did not write plays.&nbsp; It is said of
Rachel that there was once a five-act play in which she died at
the end of the fourth act.&nbsp; After it had had a long run she
casually asked some one <i>how it ended</i>.&nbsp; She had never
read the fifth act.&nbsp; Such a story could never have been told
of Janauschek.</p>
<p>In the summer there were one or two railroad excursions to
visit new branch roads in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; While on one of
these I visited the celebrated Mauch Chunk coal mines, and rode
on the switchback railway, where I had a fearfully narrow escape
from death.&nbsp; This switchback is a <i>montagne Russe</i>
coming up and down a hill, and six miles in length.&nbsp; Yet,
though the rate of speed is appalling, the engineer can stop the
car in a few seconds&rsquo; time with the powerful brake.&nbsp;
We were going down headlong, when all at once a cow stepped out
of the bushes on the road before us, and if we had struck her we
must have gone headlong over the cliff and been killed.&nbsp; But
by a miracle the engineer stopped the car just as we got to the
cow.&nbsp; We were saved by a second.&nbsp; Something very like
it had occurred to my wife and to me in 1859.&nbsp; We were going
to Reading by rail, when the train ran off the track and went
straight for an embankment where there was a fall of 150
feet.&nbsp; It was stopped just as the locomotive protruded or
looked over the precipice.&nbsp; Had there been the <i>least
trifle</i> more of steam on at that instant we must all have
perished.</p>
<p>In November of this my second year on the <i>Press</i> my
father died.&nbsp; One thing occurred on this sad bereavement
which alleviated it a little.&nbsp; I had always felt all my <!--
page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>life that he had never been satisfied with my want of a
fixed career or position.&nbsp; He did not, I think, <i>very</i>
much like John Forney, the audacious, reckless politician, but he
still respected his power and success, and it astonished him a
little, and many others quite as much, to find that I was in many
respects Forney&rsquo;s right-hand man, and manager of a bold
political paper which had a great influence.&nbsp; A day or two
before he died my father expressed himself kindly to the effect
that I had at last done well, and that he was satisfied with
me.&nbsp; At last, after so many years, he felt that I had
<i>&eacute;tat</i>&mdash;a calling, a definite position.&nbsp; In
fact, in those days it was often said that Forney could make
himself President, as he indeed might have done but for certain
errors, no greater than have been committed by more successful
men, and a stroke of ill-luck such as few can resist.</p>
<p>The winter passed quietly.&nbsp; I was extremely fond of my
life and work.&nbsp; Summer came, and with it a great desire for
a change and wild life and the West, for I had worked very
hard.&nbsp; A very great railway excursion, which was destined to
have a great effect, was being organised, and both my wife and I
were invited to join it.&nbsp; Mr. John Edgar Thompson, the
president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Mr. Hinckley, of the
Baltimore road, President Felton, Professor Leidy, Robert
Lamborn, and a number of other notables, were to go to Duluth, on
Lake Superior, and decide on the terminus of the railroad as a
site for a city.&nbsp; Mrs. John E. Thompson had her own private
car, which was seventy feet in length, and fitted up with every
convenience and luxury.&nbsp; To this was added the same
directors&rsquo; car in which I had travelled to Minnesota.&nbsp;
There were to be in all ten or twelve gentlemen and ten
ladies.&nbsp; There was such efficient service that one young
man, a clerk, was detailed especially to look after our
luggage.&nbsp; As we stopped every night at some hotel, he would
inquire what we required to be taken to our rooms, and saw that
it was brought back in the morning.&nbsp; I went off in such a
hurry that I forgot my Indian blanket, nor had <!-- page 348--><a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>I any
revolver or gun, all of which, especially the blanket, I sadly
missed ere I returned.&nbsp; I got, before I left, a full white
flannel or fine white cloth suit, which was then a startling
novelty, and wore it to the Falls of the Mississippi.&nbsp;
Little did I foresee that ere it gave out I should also have it
on at the Cataracts of the Nile!</p>
<p>So we started and after a few hours&rsquo; travel, stopped at
Altona.&nbsp; There I was very much amused by an old darkey at
the railway-station hotel, who had, as he declared,
&ldquo;specially the kyar of de ladies an&rsquo;
quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been a slave till the war broke out,
and had been wondrously favoured by visions and revelations which
guided him to freedom.&nbsp; &ldquo;De Lawd he &rsquo;pear to me
in a dream, an&rsquo; I hyar a vi&rsquo;ce which cry,
&lsquo;Simon, arise an&rsquo; git out of dis, an&rsquo; put
fo&rsquo; de Norf as fass as you kin travel, fo&rsquo; de day of
de &rsquo;pressor is at an end, an&rsquo; you is to be
free.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I rosed an&rsquo; fled, hardly
a-waitin&rsquo; to stuff my bag wid some corn-dodgers an&rsquo;
bacon, an&rsquo; foller de Norf Star till I git confused
an&rsquo; went to sleep agin, wen, lo, an angel expostulated
hisself befo&rsquo; my eyes in a wision, an&rsquo; say,
&lsquo;Simon, beholdes&rsquo; dou dat paff by de riber?&nbsp;
Dat&rsquo;s de one fo&rsquo; you to foller, ole son!&rsquo;&nbsp;
So I follers it till I git on de right trail.&nbsp; Den I met
anoder nigger a-&rsquo;scapin&rsquo; from the bon&rsquo;s of
captivity, an&rsquo; carryin&rsquo; a cold ham, an&rsquo; I jined
in wid him&mdash;you bet&mdash;an&rsquo; so we come to de
Lawd&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so gaily on to Chicago.&nbsp; We went directly to the
first hotel, and as soon as I had toiletted and gone below, I saw
on the opposite building a sign with the words <i>Chicago
Tribune</i>.&nbsp; This was an exchange of ours, so I crossed
over, and meeting the editor by chance in the doorway, was
welcomed and introduced to Governor Desbrosses, who stood
by.&nbsp; Then I went to a telegraph office and sent a despatch
to the <i>Press</i>.&nbsp; The man wanted me to pay.&nbsp; I told
him to C. O. D., &ldquo;collect on delivery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
declined.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Your principal office is in
Philadelphia, is it not?&mdash;Third and Chestnut Streets.&nbsp;
Just send a telegram and ask the name of your landlord.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s Leland, and <i>I&rsquo;m the man</i>.&nbsp; If you
make me <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>pay, I&rsquo;ll raise your
rent.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed heartily and let me off, but not
without a parting shot: &ldquo;You see, Mr. Leland, there are so
many scallawags <a name="citation349"></a><a href="#footnote349"
class="citation">[349]</a> from the East come here, that we are
obliged to be a little particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to the hotel, and was immediately introduced to
some one having authority.&nbsp; I narrated my late
experience.&nbsp; He looked at me and said, &ldquo;How long have
you been in Chicago?&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;About thirty
minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He answered gravely, &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;d better <i>stay</i> here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll suit the
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was beginning to feel the moral influence
of the genial air of the West.&nbsp; Chicago is emphatically what
is termed &ldquo;a place,&rdquo; and a certain amount of calm
confidence in one&rsquo;s self is not in that city to any
one&rsquo;s discredit.&nbsp; Once there was an old lady of a
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; type in the witness-box in an American
city.&nbsp; She glared round at the judge, the jury, and the
spectators, and then burst out with, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t all
be staring at me in that way.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t keer a --- for
you all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lived eleven years in Chicago, and
ain&rsquo;t affeard of the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chicago is said in
Indian to mean the place of skunks, but calling a rose a
skunk-cabbage don&rsquo;t make it one.</p>
<p>Walking on the edge of the lake near the city, the waters cast
up a good-sized living specimen of that extraordinary
fish-lizard, the great <i>menobranchus</i>, popularly known as
the hell-bender from its extreme ugliness.&nbsp; Owing to the
immense size of its spermatozoa, it has rendered great aid to
embryology, a science which, when understood <i>au fond</i>, will
bring about great changes in the human race.&nbsp; We were taken
out in a steamboat to the end of the great aqueduct, which was,
when built, pronounced, I think by the London <i>Times</i>, to be
the greatest engineering work of modern times.</p>
<p>In due time we came to St. Paul, Minnesota.&nbsp; We went to a
very fair hotel and had a very good dinner.&nbsp; In the West it
is very common among the commonalty to drink coffee and milk
through dinner, and indeed with all meals, <!-- page 350--><a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>instead of
wine or ale, but the custom is considered as vulgar by
swells.&nbsp; Having finished dessert, I asked the Irish waiter
to bring me a small cup of black coffee and brandy.&nbsp; Drawing
himself up stiffly, Pat replied, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t serve
caafy at dinner in <i>this</i> hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a
grand roar of laughter which the waiter evidently thought was at
<i>my</i> expense, as he retreated smiling.</p>
<p>We were kindly received in St. Paul by everybody.&nbsp; There
is this immense advantage of English or American hospitality over
that of all other countries, that it introduces us to the
<i>home</i>, and makes us forget that we are strangers.&nbsp;
When we were at the end of the fearfully wearisome great moral
circus known as the Oriental Congress, held all over Scandinavia
in 1890, there came to me one evening in the station a great
Norseman with his friends.&nbsp; With much would-be, ox-like
dignity he began, &ldquo;You ha-ave now experienced de glorious
haspitality off our country.&nbsp; You will go oom and
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute there!&rdquo; I exclaimed, for I was
bored to death with a show which had been engineered to tatters,
and to half defeating all the work of the Congress, in order to
glorify the King and Count Landberg.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
here in your country six weeks, and I had letters of
introduction, and have made no end of acquaintances.&nbsp; I have
been shown thousands of fireworks, which blind me, and offered
dozens of champagne, which I never touch, and public dinners,
which I did not attend.&nbsp; But during the whole time I have
never once seen the inside of a Swedish or Norwegian
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was perfectly true, nor have I ever
seen one to this day.&nbsp; There is a kind of
&ldquo;hospitality&rdquo; which consists of giving yourself a
grand treat at a tavern or <i>caf&eacute;</i>, and inviting your
strangers to it to help you to be glorified.&nbsp; But to very
domestic people and utter Philistines, <i>domestic</i> life lacks
the charm of a brass band, and the mirrors and gilding of a
restaurant or hotel; therefore, what they themselves enjoy most,
they, with best intent, but most unwisely, inflict on <!-- page
351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>more civilised folk.&nbsp; But in America and England,
where home-life is <i>worth</i> living and abounding in every
attraction, and public saloons are at a discount, the case is
reversed.&nbsp; And in these Western towns, of which many were,
so to speak, almost within hearing of the whoop of the savage or
the howl of the wolf (as Leavenworth really was), we experienced
a refinement of true hospitality in homes&mdash;kindness and tact
such as I have never known to be equalled save in Great
Britain.&nbsp; One evening I was at a house in St. Paul, where I
was struck by the beauty, refined manners, and agreeableness of
our hostess, who was a real Chippeway or Sioux Indian, and wife
of a retired Indian trader.&nbsp; She had been well educated at a
Canadian French seminary.</p>
<p>We were taken over to see the rival city of Minneapolis, of
which word my brother Henry said it was a vile grinding up
together of Greek and Indian.&nbsp; <i>Minne</i> means water;
<i>Minne-sota</i>, turbid water, and <i>Minne-haha</i> does not
signify &ldquo;laughing,&rdquo; but <i>falling</i> water.&nbsp;
This we also visited, and I found it so charming, that I was
delighted to think that for once an Indian name had been kept,
and that the young ladies of the boarding-schools of St. Paul or
Minneapolis had not christened or devilled it
&ldquo;Diana&rsquo;s Bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were received kindly by the Council of the city of
Minneapolis.&nbsp; Half of them had come from the East afflicted
with consumption, and all had recovered.&nbsp; But it is
necessary to remain there to live.&nbsp; My wife&rsquo;s cousin,
Mr. Richard Price, who then owned the great saw-mill next the
Fall of St. Anthony, came with this affliction from Philadelphia,
and got over it.&nbsp; After six years&rsquo; absence he returned
to Philadelphia, and died in six weeks of consumption.&nbsp;
Strangely enough, consumption is the chief cause of death among
the Indians, but this is due to their careless habits, wearing
wet moccasins and the like.</p>
<p>Now a great question arose.&nbsp; It was necessary for the
magnates of our party to go to Duluth, and to do this they must
make a seven days&rsquo; journey through the wilderness, <!--
page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>either on a very rough military road cut through the
woods during the war, or sometimes on no road at all.&nbsp;
Houses or post-stations, often of only one or two rooms, were
sometimes a day&rsquo;s journey apart.&nbsp; The question was
whether delicate ladies, utterly unaccustomed to anything like
hard travel could take this trip, during which they must endure
clouds of mosquitos, put up with camp-cooking, or often none, and
otherwise go through privations such as only an Indian or a
frontiersman would care to experience?&nbsp; The entire town of
St. Paul, and all the men of our party, vigorously opposed taking
the ladies, while I, joining the latter, insisted on it that they
could go; for, as I said to all assembled, where the devil is
afraid to go he sends a woman; and I had always observed that in
travelling, long after men are tired out women are generally all
right.&nbsp; They are never more played out <i>than they want to
be</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Femme plaint, femme deult,<br />
Femme est malade quand elle veult,<br />
Et par Sainte Marie!<br />
Quand elle veult elle est guerye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course <i>we</i> carried the day.&nbsp; Twelve men,
even though backed up by a city council, have no chance against
any ten women.&nbsp; To be sure women, like all other savages,
require a male leader&mdash;I mean to say, just as Goorkha
troops, though brave as lions, must have an English
captain&mdash;so they conquered under my guidance!</p>
<p>Having had experience in fitting out for the wilderness, I was
requested to see to the stores&mdash;so many hams to so many
people for so many days, so much coffee, and so forth.&nbsp; I
astonished all by insisting that there should be one <i>tin
cup</i> to every traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every glass you have
will soon be broken,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; And so it was, sooner
than I expected.&nbsp; As tin cups could not be found in St.
Paul, we bought three or four dozen small tin basins of about six
inches diameter at the rim, and when champagne was served out it
was, <i>faute de mieux</i>, drunk from these eccentric
goblets.</p>
<p><!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>In the first waggon were Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and Mrs.
Leland.&nbsp; Their driver was a very eccentric Canadian
Frenchman named Louis.&nbsp; He was to the last degree polite to
the ladies, but subject to attacks of Indian rage at mere
trifles, when he would go aside, swear, and destroy something
like a lunatic in a fury, and then return quite happy and
serene.&nbsp; I was in the second waggon with three ladies, a man
being wanted in every vehicle.&nbsp; Our driver was named George,
and he was altogether like Brigham, minus the Mexican-Spanish
element.&nbsp; George had, however, also lived a great deal among
Indians, and been at the great battle of the Chippeways and
Sioux, and was full of interesting and na&iuml;ve discourse.</p>
<p>Of course, we of the two leading waggons all talked to Louis
in French, who gave himself great airs on it.&nbsp; One morning
George asked me in confidence, &ldquo;Mr. Leland, you&rsquo;re
not all French, are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly
not,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re from
Philadelphia.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied George,
&ldquo;so I told Louis, but he says you <i>are</i> French, like
him, and shut me up by askin&rsquo; me if I hadn&rsquo;t heard
you talkin&rsquo; it.&nbsp; Now what I want to know is, if
you&rsquo;re <i>not</i> French, how came the <i>whole</i> of you
to know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I explained to George, to his
astonishment, that in the East it was usual for all well-educated
persons, especially ladies, to learn it.&nbsp; I soon became as
intimate with George as I had been with Brigham, and began to
learn Chippeway of him, and greet the Indians whom we met.&nbsp;
One day George said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have no Indian blood in you, Mr. Leland;
but weren&rsquo;t you a great deal among &rsquo;em when you were
young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve got queer little old Injun
ways.&nbsp; Whenever you stop by the roadside to talk to anybody
and sit down, you always rake the small bits of wood together and
pull out a match and make a <i>smudge</i>&rdquo; (a very smoky
fire made by casting dust on it), &ldquo;just like an Indian in
an Injun kind of way.&rdquo;&nbsp; (In after years I found this
same habit of <!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>making fires of small bits of wood
peculiar to old English gypsies.)</p>
<p>The smudge is the great summer institution of Minnesota.&nbsp;
It is the safeguard against mosquitos.&nbsp; They are all over
the State in such numbers that they constitute a plague.&nbsp; We
all wore all the time over our faces and necks a kind of guard or
veil, shaped exactly like an Egyptian <i>fanous</i> or folding
lantern.&nbsp; It is cylindrical, made of <i>tulle</i> or coarse
lace, with rings.&nbsp; At every house people sat in the porticos
over a tin bucket, in which there was a smudge&mdash;that is to
say, in smoke.&nbsp; In the evening some one goes with a tin or
iron pail containing a smudge, and fills the bedrooms with dense
smoke.&nbsp; One evening Mr. Hinckley and another of our party
went fishing without veils.&nbsp; They returned with their necks
behind swollen up as if with <i>goitres</i> or
<i>Kr&ouml;pfe</i>.&nbsp; I knew a young Englishman who with
friends, somewhere beyond Manitoba, encountered such a storm of
mosquitos that their oxen were killed, and the party saved
themselves by riding away on horseback.&nbsp; So he told me.</p>
<p>At the stations&mdash;all log-houses&mdash;the ladies
collected pillows and buffalo blankets, and, making a great bed,
all slept in one room.&nbsp; We men slept in waggons or under a
tent, which was not quite large enough for all.&nbsp; The Indian
women cut spruce twigs and laid them over-lapping on the ground
for our bed.&nbsp; By preference I took the outside, <i>al
fresco</i>.&nbsp; One night we stayed at a house which had an
upper and a lower storey.&nbsp; The ladies camped upstairs.&nbsp;
In the morning, when we men below awoke, all took a drink of
whisky.&nbsp; There entered a very tall Indian, clad in a long
black blanket, who looked on very approvingly at the
drinking.&nbsp; I called to my wife above to hand me down my
whisky flask.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a big Indian here who wants a
drink,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;who that big Indian is,&rdquo; but handed down
the flask.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste whisky on an
<i>Indian</i>&rdquo; said one of my companions.&nbsp; But I
filled the cup with a tremendous slug, and handed it <!-- page
355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>to
the Objibway.&nbsp; He took it down like milk, and never a word
spoke he, but when it was swallowed he looked at me and
winked.&nbsp; Such a wink as that was!&nbsp; I think I see it
now&mdash;so inspired with gratitude and humour as to render all
words needless.&nbsp; He had a rare sense of tact and
gratitude.&nbsp; Soon after I was sitting out of doors among a
few ladies, when the Indian, who had divined that I was short of
Chippeway and wished to learn, stalked up, and pointing to our
beauty, said gravely, <i>squoah</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
woman.&nbsp; Then he indicated several other articles, told me
the Indian name for each and walked away.&nbsp; It was all he
could do.&nbsp; The ladies, who could not imagine why this
voluntary lesson was given to me, were much amused at it.&nbsp;
But I understood it; he had seen the Injun in me at a glance, and
knew what I wanted most!</p>
<p>One night we stopped at a place called Kettle River.&nbsp; It
was very picturesque.&nbsp; Over the rushing stream the high
rocky banks actually overhung the water.&nbsp; I got into a birch
canoe with my wife, and two Indian boys paddled us, while others
made a great fire on the cliff above, which illuminated the
scene.&nbsp; Other Indian youths jumped into the water and swam
about and skylarked, whooping wildly.&nbsp; It reminded me
strangely of the Blue Grotto of Capri, where our boatmen jumped
in and swam in a sulphur-azure glow, only that this was red in
the firelight.</p>
<p>Our whisky ran short&mdash;it always does on all such
excursions&mdash;and our drivers in consequence became very
&ldquo;short&rdquo; also, or rather unruly.&nbsp; But <i>bon
chemin</i>, <i>mal chemin</i>, we went on, and the ladies, as I
had predicted, pulled through merrily.</p>
<p>One day, at a halt, I found, with the ladies, in the woods by
a stream, a pretty sight.&nbsp; It was a wigwam, which was very
open, and which had been made to look like a bower with green
boughs.&nbsp; When I was in the artillery I was the only person
who ever thus adorned our tent in Indian style.&nbsp; It is very
pleasant on a warm day, and looks artistic.&nbsp; In the wigwam
<!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>sat a pretty Indian woman with a babe.&nbsp; The ladies
were, of course, at once deeply interested, but the Indian could
not speak English.&nbsp; One of the ladies had a common Japanese
fan, with the picture of a grotesque god, and I at once saw my
way to interest our hostess.</p>
<p>I once read in the journal of a missionary&rsquo;s wife in
Canada that she had a curious Malay or Cingalese dagger, with a
curved blade and wooden sheath, while on the handle was the
figure of an idol.&nbsp; One day she showed this to an Indian,
and the next day he came with five more, and these again with
fifteen, till it seemed as if the whole country had gone wild
over it.&nbsp; Very much alarmed at such heathenism, the lady
locked it up and would show it no more.&nbsp; Ere she did so, she
asked an old Indian how it was possible to make a scabbard of one
piece of wood, with a hole in it to fit the blade.&nbsp; This
man, who had been one of the most devoted admirers of the deity
on the handle, saw no puzzle in this.&nbsp; He explained that the
hole was burned in by heating the blade.</p>
<p>I showed the god on the fan to the Indian woman, and said,
&ldquo;<i>Manit&#363;</i>&mdash;<i>ktchee manit&#363;</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;a god&mdash;a great god&rdquo;).&nbsp; She saw at once
that it was heathen, and her heart went out unto it with great
delight.&nbsp; With a very few Chippeway words and many signs I
explained to her that forty days&rsquo; journey from us was the
sea, and forty days beyond another country where the people had
this <i>manitou</i>.&nbsp; I believe that the lady gave her the
fan, and it may be that she worships it to this day.&nbsp; How
absurd it is to try to force on such people Catholic or
Protestant forms, which they do <i>not</i> understand and never
will, while their souls take in with joy the poly-pantheistic
developments of supernaturalism, and that which suits their
lives.&nbsp; Like the little boy who <i>thought</i> he would like
to have a Testament, but <i>knew</i> he wanted a squirt, the
Indian, unable to rise to the grandeur of monotheistic
trinitarianism, is delighted with goblins, elves, and
sorcery.&nbsp; He can manage the squirt.</p>
<p><!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>At Fond-du-Lac I became acquainted with a Mr. Duffy, a
very genial and clever man, a son of a former governor of Rhode
Island.&nbsp; He had an Indian wife and family, and was looked up
to by the Indians as <i>Kitchim&#333;komon</i>, &ldquo;the white
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he was a gentleman will appear from the
following incident.&nbsp; There was one of our party who, to put
it mildly, was not remarkable for refinement.&nbsp; A trader at
Fond-du-Lac had a very remarkable carved Indian pipe, for which
he asked me fifteen dollars.&nbsp; It certainly was rather a high
price, so I offered ten.&nbsp; Immediately the man of whom I
spoke laid down fifteen dollars and took the pipe.&nbsp; He was
<i>dans son droit</i>, but the action was churlish.&nbsp; It
seemed so to Duffy, who was standing by.&nbsp; After I had
returned to Philadelphia, Mr. Duffy sent me a very handsome pipe
for a present, which he assured me had been smoked at two grand
councils.&nbsp; He was indeed a &ldquo;white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an old Indian here whose name in Indian meant
&ldquo;He who changes his position while sitting,&rdquo; but
white people called him Martin &ldquo;for short.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was wont to smoke a very handsome pipe.&nbsp; One day, seeing him
smoking a wretched affair rudely hewn, I asked him if he had not
a better.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;I had, but I sold it to the
<i>kcheemo-komon iqueh</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the long-knife woman
(<i>i.e.</i>, to a white lady).&nbsp; Inquiry proved that the
&ldquo;long-knife woman&rdquo; was Miss Lottie Foster, a very
beautiful and delicate young lady from Philadelphia, to whom such
a barbaric term seemed strangely applied.&nbsp; As for me,
because I always bought every stone pipe which I could get, the
Indians called me <i>Poaugun</i> or Pipe.&nbsp; Among the
Algonkin of the East in after-days I had a name which means <i>he
who seeks hidden things</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, mysteries).</p>
<p>We came to Duluth.&nbsp; There were in those days exactly six
houses and twenty-six Indian wigwams.&nbsp; However, we were all
accommodated somehow.&nbsp; Here there were grand conferences of
the railroad kings with the authorities of Duluth and Superior
City, which was a few miles distant, and <!-- page 358--><a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>as the
Dulutherans outbid the Father Superiors, the terminus of the road
was fixed at Duluth.</p>
<p>It was arranged that the ladies should remain at Duluth while
we, the men, were to go through the woods to examine a situation
a day&rsquo;s march distant.&nbsp; We had Indians to carry our
luggage.&nbsp; Every man took a blanket and a cord, put his load
into it, turned the ends over the cord, and then drew it up like
a bag.&nbsp; They carried very easily from 150 to 250 lbs. weight
for thirty miles a day over stock and stone, up and down steep
banks or amid rotten crumbling trees and moss.&nbsp; Though a
good walker, I could not keep up with them.</p>
<p>I had with me a very genial and agreeable man as walking
companion.&nbsp; His name was Stewart, and he was mayor, chief
physician, and filled half-a-dozen other leading capacities in
St. Paul.&nbsp; Our fellow-travellers vanished in the
forest.&nbsp; Mayor Stewart and I with one Indian carrier found
ourselves at two o&rsquo;clock very thirsty indeed.&nbsp; The
view was beautiful enough.&nbsp; A hundred yards below us by the
steep precipice rushed the St. Lawrence, but we could not get at
it to drink.</p>
<p>Stewart threw himself on the grass in despair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re lost in the
wilderness, and I&rsquo;m going to die of thirst.&nbsp; Remember
me to my family.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he suddenly
cried, &ldquo;ask that Injun the name of that river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked of the Indian, &ldquo;<i>Wa go nin-iu</i>?&rdquo;
(&ldquo;How do you call that?&rdquo;)&nbsp; Thinking I wanted to
know the name for a stream, he replied,
&ldquo;<i>Sebe</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the same as <i>sipi</i>
in Missis-sippi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; groaned Stewart.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is no such river as the <i>Sebe</i> laid down on the map.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re lost in an unknown region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It occurs to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that this is a
judgment on me.&nbsp; When I think of the number of times in my
life when I have walked past bar-rooms and neglected to go in and
take a drink, I must think that it is a retribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say,&rdquo; replied Stewart, &ldquo;that if you
ever do get <!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>back to civilisation, you&rsquo;ll
be the old --- toper that ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we came to the camp we found there by mere chance a large
party of surveyors.&nbsp; As there were thirty or forty of us, it
was resolved, as so many white men had never before been in that
region, to constitute a township and elect a member to the
Legislature, or Congress, or something&mdash;I forget what; but
it appeared that it was legal, and it was actually done&mdash;I
voting with the rest as a settler.&nbsp; I, too, am a
<i>Minnesot</i>.</p>
<p>We railroad people formed one party and sat at our evening
meal by ourselves, the surveyors made another, and the Indians a
third <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; An open tin of
oysters was before us, and somebody said they were not
good.&nbsp; One only needs say so to ruin the character of an
oyster&mdash;and too often of &ldquo;a human bivalve,&rdquo; as
the Indiana orator said.&nbsp; We were about to pitch it away,
when I asked the attendant to give it to the Indians.&nbsp; It
was gravely passed by them from man to man till it came to the
last, who lifted it to his mouth and <i>drank off the entire
quart</i>, <i>oysters and all</i>, as if it had been so much
cider.&nbsp; Amazed at this, I asked what it meant, but the only
explanation I could get was, &ldquo;He like um oyster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a charming excursion, all through the grene wode
wilde, and I enjoyed it.&nbsp; I had Indian society, and learned
Indian talk, and bathed in charming rushing waters, and saw
enormous pine trees 300 feet high, and slept <i>al fresco</i>,
and ate <i>ad libitum</i>.&nbsp; To this day its remembrance
inspires in me a feeling of deep, true poetry.</p>
<p>I think it was at Duluth that one morning there was brought in
an old silver cross which had just been found in an Indian grave
on the margin of the lake, not very far away.&nbsp; I went there
with some others.&nbsp; It was evidently the grave of some
distinguished man who had been buried about a hundred years
ago.&nbsp; There were the decayed remains of an old-fashioned
gun, and thousands of small beads adhering, still <!-- page
360--><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>in
pattern, to the <i>tibi&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; I dug up
myself&mdash;in fact they almost lay on the surface, the sand
being blown away&mdash;several silver bangles, which at first
looked exactly like birch-bark peelings, and, what I very much
prized, two or three stone cylinders or tubes, about half an inch
in diameter, with a hole through them.&nbsp; Antiquaries have
been much puzzled over these, some thinking that they were
musical instruments, others implements for gambling.&nbsp; My own
theory always was that they were used for smoking tobacco, and as
those which I found were actually stuffed full of dried
semi-decayed &ldquo;fine cut,&rdquo; I still hold to it.&nbsp; I
also purchased from a boy a red stone pipe-head, which was found
in the same grave.&nbsp; I should here say that the pipe which
had been bought away from me by the man above mentioned had on it
the carving of a <i>reindeer</i>, which rendered it to me alone
of living men peculiarly valuable, since I have laboured hard,
and subsequently set forth in my &ldquo;Algonkin Legends&rdquo;
the theory that the Algonkin Indians went far to the North and
there mingled with the Norsemen of Greenland and Labrador.&nbsp;
The man who got the pipe promised to leave it to me when he died,
but he departed from life and never kept his word.&nbsp; A
frequent source of grief to me has been to see objects of great
value, illustrating some point in arch&aelig;ology, seized as
&ldquo;curiosities&rdquo; by ignorant wealthy folk.&nbsp; The
most detestable form of this folly is the buying of
<i>incunabula</i>, first editions or uncut copies, and keeping
them from publication or reading, and, in short, of worshipping
anything, be it a book or a coin, merely because it is
<i>rare</i>.&nbsp; Men never expatiate on <i>rariora</i> in
literature or in china, or talk cookery and wines over-much,
without showing themselves prigs.&nbsp; It is not any beauty in
the <i>thing</i>, but the delightful sense of their own culture
or wealth which they cultivate.&nbsp; When there is nothing in a
thing but mere <i>rarity</i> and cost to commend it, it is
absolutely worthless, as is the learning and connoisseurship
thereupon dependent.</p>
<p>Business concluded, we took a steamboat, and were very <!--
page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>sea-sick on Lake Superior for twenty-four hours.&nbsp;
Then we went to the Isle Royale, and saw the mines, which had
been worked even by the ancient Mexicans; also an immense mass of
amethysts.&nbsp; The country here abounds in agates.&nbsp; At
Marquette there was brought on board a single piece of pure
virgin copper from the mine which weighed more than 4,000
pounds.&nbsp; There it was, I think, that we found our cars
waiting, and returned in them to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It was at this time that my brother Henry died, and his loss
inflicted on me a terrible mental blow, which went far,
subsequently, to bring about a great crisis in my health.&nbsp;
My dear brother was the most remarkable illustration of the fact
that there are men who, by no fault of their own, and who,
despite the utmost honour or integrity, deep intelligence, good
education, and varied talents, are overshadowed all their lives
by sorrow, and meet ill-luck at every turn.&nbsp; He went at
sixteen as <i>employ&eacute;</i> into a Cuban importing house,
where he learned Spanish.&nbsp; His principal failed, and thence
he passed to a store in New York, where he worked far too hard
for $600 a year.&nbsp; His successor, who did much less, was
immediately paid $2,500 per annum.&nbsp; Finding that his
employer was being secretly ruined by his partner, he warned the
former, but only with the result of being severely reprimanded by
the merchant and my father as a mischief-maker.&nbsp; After a
while this merchant was absolutely ruined and bankrupted by his
partner, as he himself declared to me, but, like many men, still
kept his <i>rancune</i> against my poor brother.&nbsp; By this
time the eyesight and health of Henry quite gave out for some
time.&nbsp; Every effort which he made, whether to get
employment, to become artist or writer, failed.&nbsp; He
published two volumes of tales, sporting sketches, &amp;c., with
Lippincott, in Philadelphia, which are remarkable for
originality.&nbsp; One of them was subsequently written out by
another distinguished author in another form.&nbsp; I do not say
it was after my brother&rsquo;s, for I have known another case in
which two men, having heard a story from Barnum, both published
it, <!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>ignorant that the other had done
so.&nbsp; But I would declare, in justice to my brother, that he
told this story, which I am sure the reader knows, quite as well
as did the other.</p>
<p>He travelled a great deal, was eighteen months in Rome and its
vicinity, visited Algeria, Egypt, and Cuba and the West, always
spending so little money that my father expressed his amazement
at it.&nbsp; I regret to say that in my youth I never astonished
him in this way.&nbsp; But this morbid conscientiousness or
delicacy as to being dependent did him no good, for he might just
as well have been thoroughly comfortable, and my father would
never have missed it.&nbsp; The feeling that he could get no
foothold in life, which had long troubled me, became a haunting
spectre which followed him to the grave.&nbsp; His work
&ldquo;Americans in Rome&rdquo; is one of the cleverest, most
sparkling, and brilliant works of humour, without a trace of
vulgarity, ever written in America.&nbsp; It had originally some
such title as &ldquo;Studios and Mountains,&rdquo; but the
publisher, thinking that the miserable clap-trap title of
&ldquo;Americans in Rome&rdquo; would create an impression that
there was &ldquo;gossip,&rdquo; and possibly scandal, in it,
insisted on that.&nbsp; It was published in the weary panic of
1862 in the war, and fell dead from the press.&nbsp; Though he
never really laughed, and was generally absolutely grave, my
brother had an incredibly keen sense of fun, and in conversation
could far outmaster or &ldquo;walk over the head&rdquo; of any
humorist whom I ever met.&nbsp; He was very far, however, from
showing off or being a professional wit.&nbsp; He was very fond,
when talking with men who considered themselves clever, of making
jests or puns in such a manner and in such an unaffected ordinary
tone of voice that they took no note of the
<i>quodlibets</i>.&nbsp; He enjoyed this much more than causing a
laugh or being complimented.&nbsp; But taking his life through,
he was simply unfortunate in everything, and his worst failures
were when he made wisely directed energetic efforts to benefit
himself or others.&nbsp; He rarely complained or grieved, having
in him a deep <i>fond</i> of what I, for want of a better term,
call <i>Indian nature</i>, or <!-- page 363--><a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>stoicism,
which is common in Americans, and utterly incomprehensible to, or
rarely found in, a European.</p>
<p>The death of my father left me a fifth of his property, which
was afterwards somewhat augmented by a fourth share of my poor
brother&rsquo;s portion.&nbsp; For one year I drew no money from
the inheritance, but went on living as before on my earnings, so
that my wife remarked it really took me a year to realise that I
had any money.&nbsp; After some months I bought a house in Locust
Street, just opposite to where my father had lived, and in this
house I remained six months previously to going to Europe in
1869.&nbsp; We had coloured servants, and I never in all my life,
before or since, lived so well as during this time.&nbsp; The
house was well furnished; there was even the great luxury of no
piano, which is a great condition of happiness.</p>
<p>This year I was fearfully busy.&nbsp; As I had taken the
dramatic criticism in hand, for which alone we had always
employed a man, I went during twelve months 140 times to the
opera, and every evening to several theatres, <i>et
cetera</i>.&nbsp; Once I was caught beautifully.&nbsp; There had
been an opera bouffe, the &ldquo;Grande Duchesse&rdquo; or
something, running for two or three weeks, and I had written a
criticism on it.&nbsp; This was laid over by &ldquo;press of
matter,&rdquo; but as the same play was announced for the next
night with the same performers, we published the critique.&nbsp;
But it so chanced that the opera by some accident was not
played!&nbsp; The <i>Evening Bulletin</i>, my old paper, rallied
me keenly on this blunder, and I felt badly.&nbsp; John Forney,
jun., however, said it was mere rubbish of no consequence.&nbsp;
He was such an arrant Bohemian and hardened son of the press,
that he regarded it rather as a joke and a feather in our caps,
indicating that we were a bounding lot, and not tied down to
close observances.&nbsp; Truly this is a very fine spirit of
freedom, but it may be carried too far, as I think it was by a
friend of mine, who had but one principle in life, and that was
<i>never</i> to write his newspaper correspondence in the place
from which it was dated.&nbsp; It <!-- page 364--><a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>came to
pass that about three weeks after this retribution overtook the
<i>Bulletin</i>, for it also published a review of an opera which
was not sung, but I meanly passed the occurrence by without
comment.&nbsp; When a man hits you, it is far more generous,
manly, and fraternal to hit him back a good blow than to degrade
him by silent contempt.</p>
<p>The Presidential campaign between Grant and Johnson was
beginning to warm up.&nbsp; Colonel Forney was in a cyclone of
hard work between Washington, Pennsylvania, and New York,
carrying on a thousand plots and finely or coarsely drawn
intrigues, raising immense sums, speaking in public, and, not to
put it too finely, buying or trading votes in a thousand tortuous
or &ldquo;mud-turtlesome and possum-like ways&rdquo;&mdash;for
<i>non possumus</i> was not in his Latin.&nbsp; Never shall I
forget the disgust and indignation with which the great
Republican champion entered the office one evening, and, flinging
himself on a chair, declared that votes in New Jersey had gone up
to sixty dollars a head!&nbsp; And I was forced to admit that
sixty dollars for a Jerseyman did seem to be an exorbitant
price.&nbsp; So he went forth on the war-path with fresh paint
and a sharp tomahawk.</p>
<p>It often happened to me in his absence to have very curious
and critical decisions in my power.&nbsp; One of these is the
&ldquo;reading in&rdquo; or &ldquo;reading out&rdquo; of a man
from his party.&nbsp; This is invariably done by a leading
political newspaper.&nbsp; I remember, for instance, a man who
had been very prominent in politics, and gone over to the
Democrats, imploring me to readmit him to the fold; but, as I
regarded him as a mere office-hunter, I refused to do it.&nbsp;
<i>Excommunicatus sit</i>!</p>
<p>There was a <i>very</i> distinguished and able man in a very
high position.&nbsp; To him I had once addressed a letter begging
a favour which would have been nothing at all to grant, but which
was of great importance to me, and he had taken no notice of
it.&nbsp; It came to pass that we had in our hands to publish
certain very damaging charges against this great man.&nbsp; He
found it out, and, humiliated, I may say agonised <!-- page
365--><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>with shame and fear, he called with a friend, begging
that the imputations might not be published.&nbsp; I believe from
my soul that if I had not been so badly treated by him I should
have refused his request, but, as it was, I agreed to withdraw
the charges.&nbsp; It was the very best course, as I afterwards
found.&nbsp; I am happy to say that, in after years, and in other
lands, he showed himself very grateful to me.&nbsp; I am by
nature as vindictive as an unconverted Indian, and as I am deeply
convinced that it is vile and wicked, I fight vigorously against
it.&nbsp; In my <i>Illustrated News</i> days in New York I used
to keep an old German hymn pasted up before me in the sanctum to
remind me not to be revengeful.&nbsp; Out of all such battling of
opposing principles come good results.&nbsp; I feel this in
another form in the warring within me of superstitious
<i>feelings</i> and scientific convictions.</p>
<p>It became apparent that on Pennsylvania depended the election
of President.&nbsp; The State had only been prevented from
turning Copperhead-Democrat&mdash;which was the same as
seceding&mdash;by the incredible exertions of the Union League,
led by George H. Boker, and the untiring aid of Colonel
Forney.&nbsp; But even now it was very uncertain, and in fact the
election&mdash;on which the very existence of the Union virtually
depended&mdash;was turned by only a few hundred votes; and, as
Colonel Forney and George H. Boker admitted, it would have been
lost but for what I am going to narrate.</p>
<p>There were many thousand Republican Clubs all through the
State, but they had no one established official organ or
newspaper.&nbsp; This is of vast importance, because such an
organ is sent to doubtful voters in large numbers, and gives the
keynote or clue for thousands of speeches and to men stumping or
arguing.&nbsp; It occurred to me early to make the <i>Weekly
Press</i> this organ.&nbsp; I employed a young man to go to the
League and copy all the names and addresses of all the thousands
of Republican clubs in the State.&nbsp; Then I had the paper
properly endorsed by the League, and sent a copy to <!-- page
366--><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>every club at cost price or for nothing.&nbsp; This
proved to be a <i>tremendous</i> success.&nbsp; It cost us money,
but Colonel Forney never cared for that, and he greatly admired
the <i>coup</i>.&nbsp; I made the politics hot, to suit country
customers.&nbsp; I found the gun and Colonel Forney the powder
and ball, and between us we made a hit.</p>
<p>One day Frank Wells, of the <i>Bulletin</i> (very active
indeed in the Union League), met me and asked if I, since I had
lived in New York, could tell them anything as to what kind of a
man George Francis Train really was.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has come
over all at once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the Democratic
party, and wishes to stump Pennsylvania, if we will pay him his
expenses.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Train personally, and understand him better than
most men.&nbsp; He is really a very able speaker for a popular
American audience, and will be of immense service if rightly
managed.&nbsp; But you must get some steady, sensible man to go
with him and keep him in hand and regulate expenses,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done.&nbsp; After the election I conversed with the one
who had been the bear-leader, and he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an immense success.&nbsp; Train made thousands
of votes, and was a most effective speaker.&nbsp; His mania for
speaking was incredible.&nbsp; One day, after addressing two or
three audiences at different towns, we stopped at another to
dine.&nbsp; While waiting for the soup, I heard a voice as of a
public speaker, and looking out, saw Train standing on a load of
hay, addressing a thousand admiring auditors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are always many men who claim to have carried every
Presidential election&mdash;the late Mr. Guiteau was one of these
geniuses&mdash;but it is also true that there are many who would
by <i>not</i> working have produced very great changes.&nbsp;
Forney was a mighty wire-puller, if not exactly before the Lord,
at least before the elections, and he opined that I had secured
the success.&nbsp; There were <i>certainly</i> other
men&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Peacock, who influenced as many votes as
the <i>Weekly Press</i>, <!-- page 367--><a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>and George
Francis Train&mdash;without whose aid Pennsylvania and
Grant&rsquo;s election would have been lost, but it is something
to have been one of the few who did it.</p>
<p>When General Grant came in, he resolved to have nothing to do
with &ldquo;corrupt old politicians,&rdquo; even though they had
done him the greatest service.&nbsp; So he took up with a lot of
doubly corrupt young ones, who were only inferior to the veterans
in ability.&nbsp; Colonel Forney was snubbed cruelly, in order to
rob him.&nbsp; Whatever he had done wrongly, he had done his
<i>work</i> rightly, and if Grant intended to throw his
politicians overboard, he should have informed them of it before
availing himself of their services.&nbsp; His conduct was like
that of the old lady who got a man to saw three cords of wood for
her, and then refused to pay him because he had been
divorced.</p>
<p>I had never in my life asked for an office from anybody.&nbsp;
Mr. Charles A. Dana once said that the work I did for the
Republican party on <i>Vanity Fair</i> alone was worth a foreign
mission, and that was a mere trifle to what I did with the
<i>Continental Magazine</i>, my pamphlet, &amp;c.&nbsp; When
Grant was President, I petitioned that a little consulate worth
$1,000 (&pound;200) might be given to a poor Episcopal clergyman,
but a man accustomed to consular work, who spoke French, and who
had been secretary to two commodores.&nbsp; It was for a small
French town.&nbsp; It was supported by Forney and George H.
Boker; but it was <i>refused</i> because I was &ldquo;in
Forney&rsquo;s set,&rdquo; and the consulate was given to a
Western man who did not know French.</p>
<p>If John Forney, instead of using all his immense influence for
Grant, had opposed him tooth and nail, he could not have been
treated with more scornful neglect.&nbsp; The pretence for this
was that Forney had defaulted $40,000!&nbsp; I know every detail
of the story, and it is this:&mdash;While Forney was in Europe,
an agent to whom he had confided his affairs did take money to
that amount.&nbsp; As soon as Forney learned this, he promptly
raised $40,000 by mortgage on his property, <!-- page 368--><a
name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>and repaid
the deficit.&nbsp; Even his enemy Simon Cameron declared he did
not believe the story, and the engine of <i>his</i> revenge was
always run by &ldquo;one hundred Injun power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had &ldquo;met&rdquo; Grant several times, when one day in
London I was introduced to him again.&nbsp; He said that he was
very happy to make my acquaintance.&nbsp; I replied,
&ldquo;General Grant, I have had the pleasure of being introduced
to you <i>six times</i> already, and I hope for many happy
renewals of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A week or two after, this appeared
in <i>Punch</i>, adapted to a professor and a duchess.</p>
<p>When the Sanitary Fair was held in Philadelphia in 1863, a
lady in New York wrote to Garibaldi, begging him for some
personal souvenir to be given to the charity.&nbsp; Garibaldi
replied by actually sending the dagger which he had carried in
every engagement, expressing in a letter a hope that it might
pass to General Grant.&nbsp; But a warm partisan of McClellan so
arranged it that there should be an election for the dagger
between the partisans of Grant and McClellan, every one voting to
pay a dollar to the Fair.&nbsp; For a long time the McClellanites
were in a majority, but at the last hour Miss Anna M. Lea, now
Mrs. Lea Merritt, very cleverly brought down a party of friends,
who voted for Grant, secured the dagger for him, and so carried
out the wish of Garibaldi.&nbsp; Long after an amusing incident
occurred relative to this.&nbsp; In conversation in London with
Mrs. Grant, I asked her if the dagger had been received.&nbsp;
She replied, &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and then added na&iuml;vely,
&ldquo;but wasn&rsquo;t it really <i>alt a humbug</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death of my father and brother within a year, the sudden
change in my fortunes, the Presidential campaign, and, above all,
the working hard seven days in the week, had been too much for
me.&nbsp; I began to find, little by little, that I could not
execute half the work to which I was accustomed.&nbsp; Colonel
Forney was very kind indeed, and never said a word.&nbsp; But I
began to apprehend that a break-down in my health was
impending.&nbsp; I needed change of scene, and so resolved,
finding, after due consideration, that I had enough to live on,
<!-- page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>to go abroad for a long rest.&nbsp; It proved to be a
very wise resolve.&nbsp; So I rented my house, packed my trunks,
and departed, to be gone &ldquo;for a year or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would say, in concluding this chapter, that Colonel John
Forney was universally credited, with perfect justice, as having
carried Grant&rsquo;s election.&nbsp; When Grant was about to
deliver his inaugural speech, a stranger who stood by me, looking
at the immense expectant crowd, remarked to a friend, &ldquo;This
is a proud day for John Forney!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
replied the other, &ldquo;the Dead Duck has elected
Grant.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Forney cheerfully and generously declared
that it was the <i>Weekly Press</i> which had carried
Pennsylvania, and that I had managed it entirely alone.&nbsp; All
these things were known to thousands at the time, but we lived in
such excitement that we made but little account thereof.&nbsp;
However, there are men of good repute still living who will amply
confirm all that I have said of my work on the <i>Continental
Magazine</i>; and that Abraham Lincoln himself did actually
credit me with this is proved by the following incident.&nbsp;
Because I had so earnestly advocated Emancipation as a war
measure at a time when even the most fiery and advanced Abolition
papers, such as the <i>Tribune</i>, were holding back and
shouting <i>pas trop de z&egrave;le</i>&mdash;and as it proved
wisely, by advocating it publicly&mdash;<i>merely as a war
measure</i>&mdash;the President, at the request of George H.
Boker, actually signed for me fifty duplicate very handsome
copies of the Proclamation of Emancipation on parchment paper, to
every one of which Mr. Seward also added his signature.&nbsp; One
of these is now hanging up in the British Museum as my
gift.&nbsp; I perfectly understood and knew at the time, as did
all concerned, that this was a recognition, and a very graceful
and appropriate one, of what I had done for
Emancipation&mdash;Harvard having A.M.&rsquo;d me for the
same.&nbsp; The copies I presented to the Sanitary Fair to be
sold for its benefit, but there was not much demand for them;
what were left over I divided with George Boker.</p>

Family&mdash;Tuscany.</p>
<p>We sailed on the famed <i>Pereire</i> from New York to Brest
in May, 1869.&nbsp; We had not left port before a droll incident
occurred.&nbsp; On the table in the smoking-room lay a copy of
the &ldquo;Ballads of Hans Breitmann.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
fellow-passenger asked me, &ldquo;Is that your book?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I innocently replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me,
sir,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;it is <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but it is
really mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, I <i>bought</i>
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you did,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;it is mine&mdash;for I wrote it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was a roar of laughter, and we all became acquainted at
once.</p>
<p>General Washburne was among the passengers.&nbsp; He had been
appointed Minister to France and was going to Paris, where he
subsequently distinguished himself during the siege by literally
taking the place of seven foreign Ministers who had left, and
kindly caring for all their <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp;
It never occurred to the old frontiersman to leave a place or his
duties because fighting was going on.&nbsp; I had a fine
twelve-feet blue Indian blanket, which I had bought somewhere
beyond Leavenworth of a trader.&nbsp; When sitting on deck
wrapped in it, the General would finger a fold lovingly, and say,
&ldquo;Ah! the Indians always have good blankets!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>We arrived in Brest, and Mrs. Leland, who had never
before been in Europe, was much pleased at her first sight, early
in the morning, of a French city; the nuns, soldiers, peasants,
and all, as seen from our window, were indeed very
picturesque.&nbsp; We left that day by railway for Paris, and on
the road a rather remarkable incident occurred.&nbsp; There was
seated opposite to us a not very amiable-looking man of thirty,
who might be of the superior class of mechanics, and who
evidently regarded us with an evil eye, either because we were
suspected <i>Anglais</i> or aristocrats.&nbsp; I resolved that he
should become amicable.&nbsp; Ill-tempered though he might be, he
was still polite, for at every stopping-place he got out to
smoke, and extinguished his cigar ere he re-entered.&nbsp; I said
to him, &ldquo;Madame begs that you will not inconvenience
yourself so much&mdash;pray continue to smoke in
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; This melted him, as it would any
Frenchman.&nbsp; Seeing that he was reading the <i>Rappel</i>, I
conversed &ldquo;liberally.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him that I had
been captain of barricades in Forty-eight, and described in full
the taking of the Tuileries.&nbsp; His blood was fired, and he
confided to me all the details of a grand plot for a Revolution
which he was going up to Paris to attend to, and offered me a
prominent place among the conspirators, assuring me that I should
have a glorious opportunity to fight again at the
barricades!&nbsp; I was appalled at his want of discretion, but
said nothing.&nbsp; Sure enough, there came the
<i>&eacute;meute</i> of the plebiscite, as he had predicted, but
it was suppressed.&nbsp; George Boker wrote to me: &ldquo;When I
heard of a revolution in Paris, I knew at once that you must have
arrived and had got to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I told him
that I knew of it in advance, and had had a situation offered me
as leader, he dryly replied, &ldquo;Oh, I suppose so&mdash;as a
matter of course.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was certainly a strange
coincidence that I left Paris in Forty-eight as a Revolutionary
<i>suspect</i>, and re-entered it in 1870 in very nearly the same
capacity.</p>
<p>We found agreeable lodgings at the Rond Point of the Champs
Elys&eacute;es.&nbsp; The day after our arrival I determined to
<!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>arrange the terms of living with our landlord.&nbsp; He
and his wife had the reputation of being fearful screws in their
&ldquo;items.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he, thinking I was a newly arrived
and perfectly ignorant American, began to draw the toils, and
enumerate so much for the rooms, so much for every towel, so
much, I believe, for salt and every spoon and fork.&nbsp; I asked
him how much he would charge for everything in the lump.&nbsp; He
replied, &ldquo;<i>Mais</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>, <i>nous ne faisons
pas jamais comme cela &agrave; Paris</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Out of all
patience, I burst out into vernacular: &ldquo;<i>Sacr&eacute; nom
de Dieu et mille tonnerres</i>, <i>vieux galopin</i>! you dare to
tell <i>me</i>, a <i>vieux carabin du Quartier Latin</i>, that
you cannot make arrangements!&nbsp; <i>Et depuisse-quand</i>,
<i>s&rsquo;il vous plait</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation372"></a><a
href="#footnote372" class="citation">[372]</a>&nbsp; He stared at
me in blank amazement, and then said with a smile:
&ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>!&nbsp; <i>Monsieur est donc de
nous</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I am,&rdquo; I replied, and we
at once made a satisfactory compromise.</p>
<p>We had pleasant friends, and saw the sights and shopped; but I
began to feel in Paris for the first time that the dreaded
break-down or collapse which I had long apprehended was coming
over me.&nbsp; There was a very clever surgeon and physician
named Laborde, who was called Nelaton&rsquo;s right-hand
man.&nbsp; I met him several times, and he observed to a mutual
friend that I was evidently suffering seriously from threatening
nervous symptoms, and that he would like to attend me.&nbsp; He
did so, and gave me daily a teaspoonful of bromide of
potassium.&nbsp; This gave me sleep and appetite; but, after some
weeks or months, the result was a settled, mild melancholy and
tendency to rest.&nbsp; In fact, it was nearly eighteen months
before I recovered so that I could write or work, and <i>live</i>
as of old.</p>
<p>I had inherited from both parents, and suffered all my life
fearfully at intervals, from brachycephalic or dorsal
neuralgia.&nbsp; Dr. Laborde made short work of this by giving me
appallingly strong doses of <i>tincture of aconite and sulphate
</i><!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span><i>of quinine</i>.&nbsp; Chemists
have often been amazed at the prescription.&nbsp; But in due time
the trouble quite disappeared, and I now, <i>laus Deo</i>! very
rarely ever have a touch of it.&nbsp; As many persons suffer
terribly from this disorder, which is an <i>aching</i> in the
back of the head and neck accompanied by &ldquo;sick
headache,&rdquo; I give the ingredients of the cure; the proper
quantity must be determined by the physician. <a
name="citation373"></a><a href="#footnote373"
class="citation">[373]</a></p>
<p>We dined once with Mr. Washburne, who during dinner showed his
extreme goodness of heart in a very characteristic manner.&nbsp;
Some foolish American had during the
<i>&eacute;meute</i>&mdash;in which I was to have been a leader,
had I so willed&mdash;got himself into trouble, not by fighting,
but through mere prying Yankee &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; and
mingling with the crowd.&nbsp; Such people really deserve to be
shot more than any others, for they get in the way and spoil good
fighting.&nbsp; He was deservedly arrested, and sent for his
Minister, who, learning it, at once arose, drove to the
<i>prefecture</i>, and delivered his inquisitive
compatriot.&nbsp; On another occasion we were the guests of J.
Meredith Read, then our Minister to Athens, where we met Prevost
Paradol.&nbsp; But at this time there suddenly came over me a
distaste for operas, theatres, dinners, society&mdash;in short,
of crowds, gaslight, and gaiety in any form, from which I have
never since quite recovered.&nbsp; I had for years been fearfully
overdoing it all in America, and now I was in the reaction, and
longed for rest.&nbsp; I was in that state when one could truly
say that life would be tolerable but for its amusements.&nbsp; It
is usual for most people to insist in such cases that what the
sufferer needs is &ldquo;excitement&rdquo; and &ldquo;distraction
of the mind,&rdquo; change of scene or gaiety, when in reality
the patient should be most carefully trained to repose, which is
not always easily done, for so very little attention has been
<!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>paid to this great truth, that even medical science as
yet can do very little towards calming nervous disorders.&nbsp;
In most cases the trouble lies in the presence, or unthinking
heedless influence, of other people; and, secondly, in the
absence of interesting minor occupations or arts, such as keep
the mind busy, yet not over-excited or too deeply absorbed.&nbsp;
An important element in such cases is to interest deeply the
patient in himself as a vicious subject to be subdued by his own
exertions.&nbsp; No one who has <i>never</i> had the gout
severely can form any conception of the terribly arrogant
irritability which accompanies it.&nbsp; I say <i>arrogant</i>,
because it is independent of any voluntary action of the
mind.&nbsp; I have often felt it raging in me, and laughed at it,
as if it were a chained wild beast, and conversed with perfect
serenity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even our dearest friends,
generally women, cannot, to save their very lives and souls,
refrain from having frequent piquant scenes with such tempting
subjects; while, on the other hand, the subjects are often led by
mere vanity into exhibiting themselves as something
peculiar.&nbsp; Altogether, I believe that where there is no
deeply seated hereditary or congenital defect, or no displacement
or injury from violence or disease, there is always a cure to be
hoped for, or at least possible; but this cure depends in many
cases so very much upon the wisdom and patience of friends and
physicians, that it is only remarkable that we find so many
recoveries as we do.&nbsp; Where the patient and friends are all
really persons of superior intelligence, almost miraculous cures
may be effected.&nbsp; But unfortunately, if it be not born in
us, it requires a great deal of genius to acquire properly the
real <i>dolce far niente</i>.</p>
<p>From Paris we went to Spa in the Ardennes.&nbsp; In this very
beautiful place, in a picturesque land of legends, I felt calmer
and more relieved.&nbsp; I think it was there that for the first
time I got an inkling that my name was becoming known in
Europe.&nbsp; There was a beautiful young English lady whom I
occasionally met in an artist&rsquo;s studio, who one day asked
me with some interest whom the Leland could be <!-- page 375--><a
name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>of whom one
heard sometimes&mdash;&ldquo;he writes books, I
think.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told her that I had a brother who had
written two or three clever works, and she agreed with me that he
must be the man; still she inclined to think that the name was
not Henry, but Charles.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicolas Tr&uuml;bner, whom I had not seen since 1856, came
with his wife and daughter to Spa, and this was the beginning of
a great intimacy which lasted to his death.&nbsp; Which meeting
reminds me of something amusing.&nbsp; I had written the first
third of &ldquo;Breitmann as a Politician,&rdquo; which J.
&ldquo;Camden&rdquo; Hotten had republished, promising the public
to give them the rest before long.&nbsp; This I prevented by
copyrighting the two remaining thirds in England!&nbsp; Being
very angry at this, Hotten accused me in print of having written
this conclusion expressly to disappoint and injure
<i>him</i>!&nbsp; In fact, he really seemed to think that Mr.
Tr&uuml;bner and I were only a pair of foreign rogues, bound
together to wrong Mr. J. C. Hotten out of his higher rights in
&ldquo;Breitmann.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wrote a pamphlet in which I said
this and some other things very plainly.&nbsp; Mr. Tr&uuml;bner
showed this to his lawyer, who was of the opinion that it could
not be published because it bore on libel, though there was
nothing in it worse than what I have here said.&nbsp; However,
Mr. Tr&uuml;bner had it privately printed, and took great joy,
solace, and comfort for a very long time in reading it to his
friends after dinner, or on other occasions, and as he had many,
it got pretty well about London.&nbsp; I may here very truly
remark that Mr. Hotten, in the public controversy which he had
with Mr. Tr&uuml;bner on the subject of my &ldquo;Ballads,&rdquo;
displayed an effrontery absolutely without parallel in modern
times, apropos of which <i>Punch</i> remarked&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The name of Curll will never be
forgotten,<br />
And neither will be thine, John Camden Hotten.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Spa we went to Brussels, where I remember to have seen
many times at work in the gallery the famous artist <!-- page
376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>without arms who painted with his toes.&nbsp; What was
quite a remarkable was the excellence of his copies from
Rembrandt.&nbsp; Nature succeeded in his case in &ldquo;heaping
voonders oopen voonders,&rdquo; as Tom Hood says in his
&ldquo;Rhine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I became well acquainted with Tom Hood
the younger in after years, and to this day I contribute
something every year to <i>Tom Hood&rsquo;s Annual</i>.&nbsp; At
Brussels we stayed at a charming old hotel which had galleries
one above the other round the courtyard, exactly like those of
the White Hart Inn immortalised in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was in Philadelphia a perfect specimen of such an inn,
which has of late years been rebuilt as the Bingham House.&nbsp;
While in Spa I studied Walloon.</p>
<p>From Brussels to Ghent, which I found much modernised from
what it had been in 1847, when it was still exactly as in the
Middle Age, but fearfully decayed, and, like Ferrara, literary
with grass-grown streets.&nbsp; <i>Und noch weiter</i>&mdash;to
Ostend, where for three weeks I took lessons in Flemish or Dutch
from a young professor, reading &ldquo;Vondel&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bilderdijk,&rdquo; who, if not in the world of letters
known, deserves to be.&nbsp; I had no dictionary all this time,
and the teacher marvelled that I always knew the meaning of the
words, which will not seem marvellous to any one who understands
German and has studied Anglo-Saxon and read &ldquo;Middle or
Early English.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then back to Spa to meet Mr. and Mrs.
Tr&uuml;bner and her father Octave Delepierre, who was a great
scholar in <i>rariora</i>, <i>curiosa</i>, and old French, and
<i>facile princeps</i> the greatest expert in Macaronic poetry
who ever wrote.&nbsp; May I here venture to mention that he
always declared that my later poem of &ldquo;Breitmann and the
Pope&rdquo; was the best Macaronic poem which he had ever
read?&nbsp; His reason for this was that it was the most reckless
and heedless or extravagant combination of Latin and modern
languages known to him.&nbsp; I had, however, been much indebted
to Mr. Oscar Browning for revising it.&nbsp; And so the truth,
which long in darkness lay, now comes full clearly to the light
of day.</p>
<p><!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>Thence to Li&eacute;ge, Amsterdam, the Hague, Haarlem,
and Leyden, visiting all the great galleries and many private
collections.&nbsp; At Amsterdam we saw the last grand kermess or
annual fair ever held there.&nbsp; It was a Dutch carnival, so
wild and extravagant that few can comprehend now to what extremes
&ldquo;spreeing&rdquo; can be carried.&nbsp; The Dutch, like the
Swedes, have or had the strange habit of bottling up their
hilarity and letting it out on stated occasions in uproarious
frolics.&nbsp; I saw <i>carmagnoles</i> in which men and women,
seized by a wild impulse, whirled along the street in a frantic
dance to any chance music, compelling every bystander to
join.&nbsp; I heard of a Prince from Capua, who, having been thus
<i>carmagnoled</i>, returned home in rags.</p>
<p>In Leyden I visited the Arch&aelig;ological Museum, where I by
chance became acquainted with the chief or director, who was then
engaged in rearranging his collections, and who, without knowing
my name, kindly expressed the wish that I would remain a week to
aid him in preparing the catalogue.&nbsp; As there are few works
on prehistoric relics which I do not know, and as I had for many
years studied with zeal innumerable collections of the kind, I
venture to believe that his faith in my knowledge was not quite
misplaced.&nbsp; Even as I write I have just received the
<i>Catalogue of Prehistoric Works in Eastern America</i>, by
Cyrus Thomas&mdash;a work of very great importance.</p>
<p>Thence we went to Cologne, where it was marvellous to find the
Cathedral completed, in spite of the ancient legend which asserts
that though the devil had furnished its design he had laid a
curse upon it, declaring that it should never be finished.&nbsp;
Thence up the Rhine by castles grey and smiling towns, recalling
my old foot-journey along its banks; and so on to Heidelberg,
where I stayed a month at the Black Eagle.&nbsp; Herr Lehr was
still there.&nbsp; He had grown older.&nbsp; His son was taking
dancing lessons of Herr Zimmer, who had taught me to waltz twenty
years before.&nbsp; One day I took my watch to a shop to be
repaired, when the proprietor <!-- page 378--><a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>declared
that he had mended it once before in 1847, and showed me the
private mark which he put on it at the time.</p>
<p>There were several American students, who received me very
kindly.&nbsp; I remember among them Wright, Manly, and
Overton.&nbsp; When I sat among them smoking and drinking beer,
and mingling German student words with English, it seemed as if
the past twenty years were all a dream, and that I was a
<i>Bursch</i> again.&nbsp; Overton had the reputation of being
<i>par &eacute;minence</i> the man of men in all Heidelberg, who
could take off a full quart at one pull without stopping to take
breath&mdash;a feat which I had far outdone at Munich, in my
youth, with the <i>horn</i>, and which I again accomplished at
Heidelberg &ldquo;without the foam,&rdquo; Overton himself, who
was a very noble young fellow, applauding the feat most
loudly.&nbsp; But I have since then often done it with Bass or
Alsopp, which is much harder.&nbsp; I need not say that the
&ldquo;Breitmann Ballads,&rdquo; which had recently got among the
Anglo-American students, and were by them greatly admired, did
much to render me popular.</p>
<p>I found or made many friends in Heidelberg.&nbsp; One night we
were invited to a supper, and learned afterwards that the two
children of our host, having heard that we were Americans, had
peeped at us through the keyhole and expressed great
disappointment at not finding us <i>black</i>.</p>
<p>In November we went to Dresden.&nbsp; We were so fortunate as
to obtain excellent rooms and board with a Herr and Madame
R&ouml;hn, a well-to-do couple, who, I am sure, took boarders far
more for the sake of company than for gain.&nbsp; Herr R&ouml;hn
had graduated at Leipzig, but having spent most of his life in
Vienna, was a man of exuberant jollity&mdash;a man of gold and a
gentleman, even as his wife was a truly gentle lady.&nbsp; As I
am very tall, and detest German small beds, I complained of mine,
and Herr R&ouml;hn said he had another, of which I could not
complain.&nbsp; And I certainly could not, for when it came I
found it was at least eight feet in length.&nbsp; It seems that
they had once had for a boarder a German baron <!-- page 379--><a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>who was
<i>more than seven feet</i> high, and had had this curiosity
constructed; and Herr R&ouml;hn roared with laughter as I gazed
on it, and asked if I would have it lengthened.</p>
<p>We remained in Dresden till February, and found many friends,
among whom there was much pleasant homelike hospitality.&nbsp;
Among others were Julian Hawthorne and sisters, and George
Parsons Lathrop.&nbsp; They were young fellows then, and not so
well known as they have since become, but it was evident enough
that they had good work in them.&nbsp; They often came to see me,
and were very kind in many ways.&nbsp; I took lessons in
porcelain-painting, which art I kept up for many years, and was,
of course, assiduous in visiting the galleries, Green Vault, and
all works of art.&nbsp; I became well acquainted with Passavant,
the director.&nbsp; I was getting better, but was still far from
being as mentally vigorous as I had been.&nbsp; I now attribute
this to the enormous daily dose of bromide which I continued to
take, probably mistaking its <i>influence</i> for the original
nervous exhaustion itself.&nbsp; It was not indeed till I got to
England, and substituted <i>lupulin</i> in the form of
hops&mdash;that is to say, pale ale or
&ldquo;bitter&rdquo;&mdash;in generous doses, that I quite
recovered.</p>
<p>So we passed on to Prague, which city, like everything Czech,
always had a strange fascination for me.&nbsp; There I met a
certain Mr. Vojtech Napristek (or Adalbert Thimble), who had once
edited in the United States a Bohemian newspaper with which I had
exchanged, and with whom I had corresponded, but whom I had never
before seen.&nbsp; He had established in Prague, on American
lines, a Ladies&rsquo; Club of two hundred, which we visited, and
was, I believe, owing to an inheritance, now a prosperous
man.&nbsp; Though I am not a Thimble, it also befell me, in later
years, to found and preside over a Ladies&rsquo; Art Club of two
hundred souls.&nbsp; At that time the famous legendary bridge,
with the ancient statue of St. John Nepomuk, still existed as of
yore.&nbsp; No one imagined that a time would come when they
would be washed away through sheer neglect.</p>
<p><!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>So on to Munich, where, during a whole week, I saw but
one <i>Riegelhaube</i>, a curious head-dress or chignon-cover of
silver thread, once very common.&nbsp; Even the old Bavarian
dialect seemed to have almost vanished, and I was glad to hear it
from our porter.&nbsp; Many old landmarks still existed, but King
Louis no longer ran about the streets&mdash;I nearly ran against
him once; people no longer were obliged by law to remove cigars
or pipes from their mouths when passing a sentry-box.&nbsp; Lola
Montez had vanished.&nbsp; <i>Mais o&ugrave; sont les neiges
d&rsquo;antan</i>?</p>
<p>So we went over the Brenner Pass, stopped at Innspruck, and
saw the church described by Heine in his <i>Reisebilder</i>, and
came to Verona, the Bern of the <i>Heldenbuch</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Ich will gen Bern ausreiten</i>, <i>sprach Meister
Hildebrand</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a happy thought of the Italians to put picturesque
Verona down as the first stopping-place for Northern travellers,
and I rather like Ruskin&rsquo;s idea of buying the town and
keeping it intact as a piece of <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>.&nbsp;
He might have proposed Rome while he was about it;
&ldquo;anything there can be had for money,&rdquo; says
Juvenal.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the station I alone was left to encounter
the fierce douaniers.&nbsp; One of them, inquisitive as to
tobacco, when I told him I had none, laid his finger impressively
on the mouthpiece of my pipe, remarking that where the tail of
the fox was seen the fox could not be far off.&nbsp; To which I
replied that I indeed had no tobacco, but wanted some very badly,
and that I would be much obliged to him if he would give me a
little to fill my pipe.&nbsp; So all laughed.&nbsp; My wife
entering at this instant, cried in amazement, &ldquo;Why,
Charles! where did you ever learn to talk Italian?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which shows that there can be secrets even between married
people; though indeed my Italian has always been of such inferior
quality that it is no wonder that I never boasted of it even in
confidence.&nbsp; It is, in fact, the Hand-organo dialect
flavoured with Florentine.</p>
<p>There was an old lady who stood at the door of a
curiosity-shop in Verona, and she had five pieces of
bone-carvings <!-- page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>from some old <i>scatola</i> or
marriage-casket.&nbsp; She asked a fabulous price for them, and I
offered five francs.&nbsp; She scorned the paltry sum with all
the vehemence of a susceptible soul whose tenderest feelings have
been outraged.&nbsp; So I went my way, but as I passed the place
returning, the old lady came forth, and, graciously courtesying
and smiling, held forth to me the earrings neatly wrapped in
paper, and thanked me for the five francs!&nbsp; Which indicated
to me that the good small folk of Italy had not materially
changed since I had left the country.</p>
<p>We came to Venice, and went to a hotel, where we had a room
given to us which, had we wished to give a ball, would have left
nothing to be desired.&nbsp; I counted in it twenty-seven chairs
and seven tables, all at such a distance from one another that
they seemed not to be on speaking terms.&nbsp; I do not think I
ever got quite so far as the upper end of that room while I
inhabited it&mdash;it was probably somewhere in Austria.&nbsp; I
have spoken of having met Mr. Wright at Heidelberg.&nbsp; He was
from Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The next day after my
arrival I found among the names of the departed, &ldquo;Signore
Wright-<i>Kilkes</i>, from Barre, Pennsylvania,
America.&rdquo;&nbsp; This reminded me of the Anglo-American who
was astonished at Rome at receiving invitations and circulars
addressed to him as &ldquo;Illustrissimo Varanti
Solezer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It turned out that an assistant, reading
aloud to the clerk the names from the trunks, had mistaken a very
large &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Warranted Sole
Leather</span>&rdquo; for the name of the owner.</p>
<p>And this on soles reminds me that there was a <i>femme
sole</i> or lone acrimonious British female at our hotel, who
declared to me one evening that she had <i>never</i> in all her
life been so <i>insulted</i> as she was that day at a
banker&rsquo;s; and the insult consisted in this, that she,
although quite unknown to him, had asked him to cash a cheque on
London, which he had declined to do.&nbsp; I remarked that no
banker who did business properly ever ought to cash a cheque from
a total stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;do <i>I look</i> like
an impostor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have seen
thieves and wretches of the vilest type who could not have been
distinguished from either of us as regards respectability of
appearance.&nbsp; You do not appear to know much about such
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to say, sir,&rdquo; replied the lady with
intense acidity, &ldquo;that <i>I</i> do <i>not</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But she added triumphantly, &ldquo;What do you say when I tell
you that I had my <i>cheque-book</i>?&nbsp; How could I have
possessed it if I had not a right to draw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any scamp,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;can deposit a few
pounds in a bank, buy a cheque-book, and then draw his
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next day she came to me in radiant sneering
triumph.&nbsp; She had found another banker, who was a gentleman,
with a marked emphasis, who had cashed her cheque.&nbsp; How many
people there are in this world whose definition of a gentleman is
&ldquo;one who does whatever pleases <i>us</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Florence we went directly to the Hotel d&rsquo;Europe in
the Via Tuornabuoni, where my Indian blanket vanished even while
entering the hotel, and surrounded only by the servants to whom
the luggage had been confided.&nbsp; As the landlord manifested
great disgust for me whenever I mentioned such a trifle, and as
the porter and the rest declared that they would answer soul and
body for one another&rsquo;s honesty, I had to grin and bear
it.&nbsp; I really wonder sometimes that there are not more
boarders, who, like Benvenuto Cellini, set fire to hotels or cut
up the bedclothes before leaving them.&nbsp; That worthy, having
been treated not so badly as I was at the Hotel d&rsquo;Europe
and at another in Florence, cut to pieces the sheets of his bed,
galloped away hastily, and from the summit of a distant hill had
the pleasure of seeing the landlord in a rage.&nbsp; Now people
write to the <i>Times</i>, and &ldquo;cut up&rdquo; the whole
concern.&nbsp; It all comes to the same thing.</p>
<p>In Florence I saw much of an old New York friend, the now late
Lorimer Graham.&nbsp; When he died, Swinburne wrote a poem on
him.&nbsp; He was a man of great culture and refined
manner.&nbsp; There was something sympathetic in him which <!--
page 383--><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>drew every one irresistibly into liking.&nbsp; It was
his instinct to be kind and thoughtful to every one.&nbsp; He
gave me letters to Swinburne, Lord Houghton, and others.</p>
<p>I made an acquaintance by chance in Florence whom I can never
forget: for he was a character.&nbsp; One day while in the Uffizi
Gallery engaged in studying the great Etruscan vase, now in the
Etruscan Museum, a stranger standing by me said, &ldquo;Does not
this seem to you like a mysterious book written in forgotten
characters?&nbsp; Is not a collection of such vases like a
library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that hint I spake.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see,&rdquo;
I replied, &ldquo;you refer to the so-called Etruscan Library
which an Englishman has made, and which contains only vases and
inscriptions in that now unknown tongue of Etruria.&nbsp; And
indeed, when we turn over the pages of Inghirami, Gherard, and
Gori, Gray, or Dennis, it does indeed really seem&mdash;But what
do you really think the old Etruscan language truly
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my friend,&rdquo; cried the stranger in
broad Yankee, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m barkin&rsquo; up the wrong
tree.&nbsp; I calculated to tell <i>you</i> something, but
you&rsquo;re ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both laughed and became very good friends.&nbsp; He lived
at our hotel, and had been twenty-five years in Italy, and knew
every custode in every gallery, and could have every secret
treasure unlocked.&nbsp; He was perfectly at home about
town&mdash;would stop and ask a direction of a cab-driver, and
was capable of going into an umbrella-shop when it rained.</p>
<p>We went on to Rome, and I can only say that as regards what we
saw there, my memory is confused literally with an <i>embarras de
richesses</i>.&nbsp; The Ecumenical Council was being held, at
which an elderly Italian gentleman, who possibly did not know
oxygen from hydrogen, or sin from sugar, was declared to be
infallible in his judgment of all earthly things.</p>
<p>While in Rome we saw a great deal of W. W. Story, the
sculptor, and his wife and daughter, Edith, for whom Thackeray
wrote his most beautiful tale, and I at my humble <!-- page
384--><a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>distance the ballad of &ldquo;Breitmann in Rome,&rdquo;
which contained a remarkable prophecy, of the Franco-German
war.&nbsp; At their house we met Odo Russell and Oscar Browning,
and many more whose names are known to all.&nbsp; It was there
also that a lady of the Royal English household amused us very
much one evening by narrating how the &ldquo;Breitmann
Ballads,&rdquo; owing to their odd mixture of German and English,
were favourite subjects for mutual reading and recitation among
the then youthful members of the Royal family, and what haste and
alarm there was to put the forbidden book out of the way when Her
Majesty the Queen was announced as coming.&nbsp; I also met in
Rome the American poet and painter T. Buchanan Read, who gave me
a dinner, and very often that remarkable character General
Carroll Tevis, who, having fought under most flags, and been a
Turkish bey or pacha, was now a chamberlain of the Pope.&nbsp; In
the following year he fought for the French, behaved with great
bravery in Bourbaki&rsquo;s retreat, and was decorated on the
field of battle.&nbsp; Then again, when I was in Egypt, Tevis was
at the head of the military college.&nbsp; He had fairly won his
rank of general in the American Civil War, but as there was some
disinclination or other to give it to him, I had used my
influence in his favour with Forney, who speedily secured it for
him.&nbsp; He was a perfect type of the old <i>condottiero</i>,
but with Dugald Dalgetty&rsquo;s scrupulous faith to his military
engagements.&nbsp; The American clergyman in Rome was the Rev.
Dr. Nevin, a brother of my friend Captain Nevin.&nbsp; There was
also Mrs. John Grigg, an old Philadelphia friend (now residing in
Florence), to whom we were then, as we have continually been
since, indebted for the most cordial hospitality.</p>
<p>Through the kind aid of General Tevis we were enabled to see
all the principal ceremonies of the Holy Week and Easter.&nbsp;
This year, owing to the Council, everything was on a scale of
unusual magnificence.&nbsp; I can say with Panurge that I have
seen three Popes, but will not add with him, &ldquo;and <!-- page
385--><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>little good did it ever do me,&rdquo; for Mrs. Leland
at least was much gratified with a full sight and quasi-interview
with His Holiness.</p>
<p>There was a joyous sight for a cynic to be seen in Rome in
those days&mdash;in fact, it was only last year (1891) that it
was done away with.&nbsp; This was the drawing of the lottery by
a priest.&nbsp; There was on a holy platform a holy wheel and a
holy little boy to draw the holy numbers, and a holy old priest
to oversee and <i>bless</i> the whole precious business.&nbsp;
The blessing of the devil would have been more appropriate, for
the lotteries are the curse of Italy.&nbsp; What the
Anglo-American mechanic puts into a savings bank, the Italian
invests in lotteries.&nbsp; In Naples there are now fourteen
tickets sold per annum for the gross amount of the population,
and in Florence twelve.</p>
<p>One day I took a walk out into the country with Briton
Rivi&egrave;re and some other artists.&nbsp; I had a cake or two
of colour, and Rivi&egrave;re, with wine for water, at a
<i>trattoria</i> where we lunched, made a picture of the
attendant maid.&nbsp; He pointed out to me on the road a string
of peasants carrying great loaves of coarse bread.&nbsp; They had
walked perhaps twenty miles to buy it, because in those days
people were not allowed to bake their own bread, but must buy it
at the public <i>forno</i>, which paid a tax for the
privilege.&nbsp; So long as Rome was under Papal control, its
every municipal institution, such as hospitals, prisons, and the
police, were in a state of absolutely incredible inhuman
vileness, while under everything ran corruption and
dishonesty.&nbsp; The lower orders were severely disciplined as
to their sexual morals, because it was made a rich source of
infamous taxes, as it now is in other cities of Europe; but
cardinals and the wealthier priests kept mistresses, almost
openly, since these women were pointed out to every one as they
flaunted about proudly in their carriages.</p>
<p>From Rome we passed into Pisa, Genoa, Spezzia, and Nice, over
the old Cornici road, and so again to Paris, where <!-- page
386--><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>we
remained six weeks, and then left in June, 1870, just before the
war broke out.&nbsp; While in the city we saw at different times
in public the Emperor and Empress, also the Queen of Spain.&nbsp;
The face of Louis Napoleon was indeed somewhat changed since I
saw him in London in 1848, but it had not improved so much as his
circumstances, as he was according to external appearances and
popular belief now extremely well off.&nbsp; But appearances are
deceptive, as was soon proved, for he was in reality on the verge
of a worse bankruptcy than even his uncle underwent, for the
nephew lost not only kingdom and life, but also every trace of
reputation for wisdom and honesty, remaining to history only as a
brazen royal adventurer and &ldquo;copper captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Rome our dear old friend Mrs. John Grigg showed us, as I
said, many kind attentions, which she has, in Florence, continued
to this day.&nbsp; This lady is own aunt to my old school friend
General George B. McClellan.&nbsp; At an advanced age she
executes without glasses the most exquisite embroidery
conceivable, and her heart and intellect are in keeping with her
sight.</p>

England&mdash;Salisbury, Wells, and York.</p>
<p>It is pleasant being anywhere in England in June, and the
passing from picturesque Dover to London through laughing Kent is
a good introduction to the country.&nbsp; The untravelled
American, fresh from the &ldquo;boundless prairies&rdquo; and
twenty-thousand-acre fields of wheat, sees nothing in it all but
the close cultivation of limited land; but the tourist from the
Continent perceives at once that, with most careful agriculture,
there are indications of an exuberance of wealth, true comfort,
and taste rarely seen in France or Germany.&nbsp; The many trees
of a better quality and slower growth than the weedy sprouting
poplar and willow of Normandy; the hedges, which are very
beautiful and ever green; the flowerbeds and walks about the
poorest cottage; the neatly planted, prettily bridged side roads,
all indicate a superiority of wealth or refinement such as
prevails only in New England, or rather which <i>did</i> prevail,
until the native population, going westward, was supplanted by
Irish or worse, if any worse there be at turning neatness into
dirty disorder.</p>
<p><!-- page 388--><a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>That older American population was deeply English, with
a thousand rural English traditions religiously preserved; and
the chief of these is clean <i>neatness</i>, which, when fully
carried out, always results in simple, unaffected beauty.&nbsp;
This was very strongly shown in the Quaker gardens, once so
common in Philadelphia&mdash;and in the people.</p>
<p>We arrived in London, and went directly to the
Tr&uuml;bners&rsquo;, No. 29 Upper Hamilton Terrace, N.W.&nbsp;
The first person who welcomed me was Mr. Delepierre, an idol of
mine for years; and the first thing I did was to borrow
half-a-crown of him to pay the cab, having only French money with
me.&nbsp; It was a charming house, with a large garden, so
redolent of roses that it might have served Chriemhilda of old
for a romance.&nbsp; For twenty years that house was destined to
be an occasional home and a dwelling where we were ever welcome,
and where every Sunday evening I had always an appointed place at
dinner, and a special arm-chair for the never-failing
Havannah.&nbsp; Mrs. Tr&uuml;bner had, in later years, two boxes
of Havannahs of the best, which had belonged to G. H. Lewes, and
which George Eliot gave her after his death.&nbsp; I have kept
two <i>en souvenir</i>.&nbsp; I knew a man once who had formed a
large collection of such relics.&nbsp; There was a cigar which he
had received from Louis Napoleon, and one from Bismarck, and so
forth.&nbsp; But, alas! once while away on his travels, the whole
museum was smoked up by a reckless under-graduate younger
brother.&nbsp; <i>In fumo exit</i>.</p>
<p>How many people well known to the world&mdash;or rather how
few who were not&mdash;have I met there&mdash;Edwin Arnold, G. H.
Lewes, H. Dixon, M. Van der Weyer, Frith the artist, Mrs.
Tr&uuml;bner&rsquo;s uncle Lord Napier of Magdala, Pigott, Norman
Lockyer, Bret Harte, &ldquo;and full many more,&rdquo; scholars,
poets, editors, and, withal, lady writers of every good shade,
grade, and quality.&nbsp; How many of them all have passed since
then full silently into the Silent Land, where we may follow, but
return no more!&nbsp; How many a pleasant smile and friendly
voice and firm alliances and genial acquaintances, often carried
<!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>out in other lands, date their beginning in my memory
to the house in Hamilton Terrace!&nbsp; How often have I heard by
land or sea the familiar greeting, &ldquo;I think I met you once
at the Tr&uuml;bners&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; For it was a salon, a
centre or sun with many bright and cheering rays&mdash;a
civilising institution!</p>
<p>Mrs. Tr&uuml;bner was the life of this home.&nbsp;
Anglo-Belgian by early relation and education, she combined four
types in one.&nbsp; When speaking English, she struck me as the
type of an accomplished and refined British matron; in French,
her whole nature seemed Parisienne; in Flemish, she was
altogether Flamande; and in German, Deutsch.&nbsp; If Cerberus
was three gentlemen in one, Mrs. Tr&uuml;bner was four ladies
united.&nbsp; Very well read, she conversed not only well on any
subject, but, what is very unusual in her sex, with sincere
interest, and not merely to entertain.&nbsp; If interrupted in a
conversation she resumed the subject!&nbsp; This is a remarkable
trait!</p>
<p>The next day after our arrival Mrs. Tr&uuml;bner took Mrs.
Leland, during a walk, to call on George Eliot, and that evening
G. H. Lewes, Hepworth Dixon, and some others came to a reception
at the Tr&uuml;bners&rsquo;.&nbsp; Both of these men were, as
ever, very brilliant and amusing in conversation.&nbsp; I met
them very often after this, both at their homes and about
London.&nbsp; I also became acquainted with George Eliot or Mrs.
Lewes, who left on me the marked impression, which she did on
all, of being a woman of genius, though I cannot recall anything
remarkable which I ever heard from her.&nbsp; I note this because
there were most extraordinary reports of her utterances among her
admirers.&nbsp; A young American lady once seriously asked me if
it were true that at the Sunday afternoon receptions in South
Bank one could always see rows of twenty or thirty of the
greatest men in England, such as Carlyle, Froude, and Herbert
Spencer, all sitting with their note-books silently taking down
from her lips the ideas which they subsequently used in their
writings!&nbsp; There seemed, indeed, to be afloat in America
among certain folk an idea that something enormous, <!-- page
390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>marvellous, and inspired went on at these receptions,
and that George Eliot posed as a Pythia or Sibyl, as the great
leading mind of England, and lectured while we listened.&nbsp;
There is no good portrait, I believe, of her.&nbsp; She had long
features and would have been called plain but for her solemn,
earnest eyes, which had an expression quite in keeping with her
voice, which was one not easily forgotten.&nbsp; I never detected
in her any trace of genial humour, though I doubt not that it was
latent in her; and I thought her a person who had drawn her ideas
far more from books and an acquaintance with certain types of
humanity whom she had set herself deliberately to
study&mdash;albeit with rare perception&mdash;than from an easy
intuitive familiarity with all sorts and conditions of men.&nbsp;
But she worked out <i>thoroughly</i> what she knew by the
intuition of genius, though in this she was very far inferior to
Scott.&nbsp; Thus she wrote the &ldquo;Spanish Gypsy,&rdquo;
having only seen such gypsies two or three times.&nbsp; One day
she told me that in order to write &ldquo;Daniel Deronda,&rdquo;
she had read through two hundred books.&nbsp; I longed to tell
her that she had better have learned Yiddish and talked with two
hundred Jews, and been taught, as I was by my friend Solomon the
Sadducee, the art of distinguishing Fr&auml;ulein L&ouml;wenthal
of the Ashkenazim from Senorita Aguado of the Sephardim <i>by the
corners of their eyes</i>!</p>
<p>I had read more than once Lewes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of
Goethe,&rdquo; his &ldquo;History of Philosophy and
Physiology,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;written him&rdquo; for the
Cyclop&aelig;dia.&nbsp; With him I naturally at once became well
acquainted.&nbsp; I remember here that Mr. Ripley had once
reproved me for declaring that Lewes had really a claim to be an
original philosopher or thinker; for Boston intellect always
frowned on him after Margaret Fuller condemned him as
&ldquo;frivolous and atheistic.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember that Tom
Powell had told me how he had dined somewhere in London, where
there was a man present who had really been a cannibal, owing to
dire stress of shipwreck, and how Lewes, who was there, was so
fascinated with the man-eater that he <!-- page 391--><a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>could think
of nothing else.&nbsp; Lewes told me that once, having gone with
a party of arch&aelig;ologists to visit a ruined church, he found
on a twelfth-century tombstone some illegible letters which he
persuaded the others to believe formed the name Golias, probably
having in mind the poems of Walter de Mapes.&nbsp; When I
returned from Russia I delighted him very much by describing how
I had told the fortunes by hand of six gypsy girls.&nbsp; He
declared that telling fortunes to gypsies was the very height of
impudence!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A hundred jests have passed between us
twain,<br />
Which, had I space, I&rsquo;d gladly tell again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A call which I have had, since I wrote that last line, from
John Postle Heseltine, Esq., reminds me that he was one of the
first acquaintances I made in London.&nbsp; Mr. E. Edwards, a
distinguished etcher and painter, gave me a dinner at Richmond,
at which Mr. Heseltine was present.&nbsp; In Edwards&rsquo;
studio I met with Bracquemond and Legros, both of whom etched my
portrait on copper.&nbsp; Mr. Heseltine is well known as a very
distinguished artist of the same kind, as well as for many other
things.&nbsp; Edwards was very kind to me in many ways for
years.&nbsp; Legros I found very interesting.&nbsp; There was in
Edwards&rsquo; studio the unique <i>complete</i> collection of
the etchings of M&eacute;ryon, which we examined.&nbsp; Legros
remarked of the incredibly long-continued industry manifested in
some of the pictures, that lunatics often manifested it to a high
degree.&nbsp; M&eacute;ryon, as is known, was mad.&nbsp; I had
etched a very little myself and was free of the fraternity.</p>
<p>Within a few days Mr. Strahan, the publisher, took me to Mr.
(now Lord) Tennyson&rsquo;s reception, where I met with many
well-known people.&nbsp; Among them were Lady Charlotte Locker
and Miss Jean Ingelow.&nbsp; These ladies, with great kindness,
finding that I was married, called on Mrs. Iceland, and invited
us to dine.&nbsp; I became a constant visitor for years at Miss
Ingelow&rsquo;s receptions, where I have met Ruskin, Mr. and Mrs.
S. C. Hall (whom I had seen in 1848), <!-- page 392--><a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>Calverly,
Edmund Gosse, Hamilton A&iuml;d&eacute;, Mr. and Mrs Alfred
Hunt.&nbsp; I conversed with Tennyson, but little passed between
us on that occasion.&nbsp; I got to know him far better
&ldquo;later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I here anticipate by several years two interviews which I had
with Tennyson in 1875, who had <i>ad interim</i> been deservedly
&ldquo;lauded into Lordliness,&rdquo; and which, to him at least,
were amusing enough to be recalled.&nbsp; The first was at a
dinner at Lady Franklin&rsquo;s, and her niece Miss
Cracroft.&nbsp; And here I may, in passing, say a word as to the
extraordinary kindly nature of Lady Franklin.&nbsp; I think it
was almost as soon as we became acquainted that she, learning
that I suffered at times from gout, sent me a dozen bottles of a
kind of bitter water as a cure.</p>
<p>There were at the dinner as guests Mr. Tennyson, Sir Samuel
and Lady Baker, Dr. Quain, and myself.&nbsp; There was no lack of
varied anecdote, reminiscences of noted people and of travel; but
by far the most delightful portion of it all was to watch the
gradual unfreezing of Tennyson, and how from a grim winter of
taciturnity, under the glowing influence of the sun of wine, as
the Tuscan Redi hath it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dell&rsquo; Indico Oriente<br />
Domator glorioso il Dio di Vino . . .<br />
Di quel Sol, che in Ciel vedete . . .&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he passed into a glorious summer of genial feeling.&nbsp; I
led unto it thus:&mdash;My friend Professor Palmer and I had
projected a volume of songs in English Romany or Gypsy, which is
by far the sweetest and most euphonious language in Europe.&nbsp;
My friend had translated &ldquo;Home they brought her warrior
dead,&rdquo; by Tennyson, into this tongue, and I had the MS. of
it in my pocket.&nbsp; Tennyson was very much pleased at the
compliment, and asked me to read the poem, which I did.&nbsp; The
work was by permission dedicated to him.&nbsp; At last, when
dinner was over, Tennyson, who had disposed of an entire bottle
of port, rose, and approaching me, took me <!-- page 393--><a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>gaily-gravely by both sides, as if he would lift me up,
and drawing himself up to his full height, said, &ldquo;I like to
see a poet a full-sized substantial man,&rdquo; or &ldquo;tall
and strong,&rdquo; or words to that effect.&nbsp; I replied that
it was very evident from the general appearance of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s bust that he was a very tall man, but that
though the thunder of height had hit twice&mdash;the Poet
Laureate being the second case&mdash;that I had been very
slightly singed, tall as I was.&nbsp; <i>Enfin</i>, some days
after, Tennyson in a letter invited me to call and see him should
I ever be in the Isle of Wight; which took place by mere chance
some time after&mdash;in fact, I did not know, when I was first
at the hotel in Freshwater, that Tennyson lived at a mile&rsquo;s
distance.</p>
<p>I walked over one afternoon and sent in my card.&nbsp; Mr.
Hallam Tennyson, then a very handsome young man of winsome
manner, came out and said that his father was taking his usual
<i>siesta</i>, but begged me to remain, kindly adding,
&ldquo;Because I know, Mr. Leland, he would be very sorry to have
missed you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a little time, however, Tennyson
himself appeared, and took me up to his den or studio, where I
was asked to take a pipe, which I did with great good-will, and
blew a cloud, enjoying it greatly, because I felt with my host,
as with Bulwer, that we had quickly crossed acquaintanceship into
the more familiar realm where one can talk about whatever you
please with the certainty of being understood and getting a
sympathetic answer.&nbsp; There are lifelong friends with whom
one never really gets to this, and there are acquaintances of an
hour at <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tes</i>, who &ldquo;come like
shadows, so depart,&rdquo; who talk with a touch to our
hearts.&nbsp; Bulwer and Tennyson were such to me, and
<i>apr&eacute; miro z&#299;</i>, as the gypsies say&mdash;on my
life-soul!&mdash;if I had talked with them, as I did, without
knowing who they were, I should have recalled them with quite as
much interest as I now do, and see them again in dreams.&nbsp;
And here I may add, that the common-place saying that literary
men are rarely good talkers, and generally disappointing, is not
at all confirmed by my experiences.</p>
<p><!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>After burning our tobacco, in Indian fashion, to better
acquaintance (I forgot to say that the poet had two dozen clay
pipes ranged in a small wooden rack), we went forth for a seven
miles&rsquo; walk on the Downs.&nbsp; And at last, from the
summit of one, I pointed down to a small field below, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>But first I must specify that the day before I had gone with a
young lady of fourteen summers named Bee or Beatrice Fredericson,
both of us bearing baskets, to pick blackberries for tea, and
coming to a small field which was completely surrounded by a
hedge, we saw therein illimitable blackberries glittering in the
setting sunlight, and longed to enter.&nbsp; Finding a gap which
had been filled by a dead thorn-bush, I removed the latter, and,
going in, we soon picked a quart of the fruit.&nbsp; But on
leaving we were met by the farmer, who made a to-do, charging us
with trespassing.&nbsp; To which I replied, &ldquo;Well, what is
to pay?&rdquo;&nbsp; He asked for two shillings, but was pacified
with one; and so we departed.</p>
<p>Therefore I said to Tennyson, &ldquo;I went into that field
yesterday to pick your blackberries, and your farmer caught us
and made me pay a shilling for trespassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he gravely replied, though evidently
delighted&mdash;&ldquo;Served you right!&nbsp; What business had
you to come over my hedge into my field to steal my
blackberries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mea culpa</i>,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;<i>mea
maxima culpa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Leland,&rdquo; pursued Tennyson, as gravely as
ever, grasping all the absurdity of the thing with evident
enjoyment, &ldquo;you have no idea how tourists trespass here to
get at me.&nbsp; They climb over my gate and look in at my
windows.&nbsp; It is a fact&mdash;one did so only last
week.&nbsp; But I declare that you are the very first poet and
man of letters who ever came here&mdash;to steal
blackberries!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he paused, and then added
forcibly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> believe you are a gypsy, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we talked of the old manor-houses in the neighbourhood,
and of the famous Mortstone, a supposed Saxon rude <!-- page
395--><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>monolith near by.&nbsp; I thought it prehistoric,
because I had dug out from the pile of earth supporting and
coeval with it (and indeed only with a lead-pencil) a flint flake
chipped by hand and a bit of cannel coal, which indicate
dedication.&nbsp; My host listened with great interest, and then
told me a sad tale: how certain workmen employed by him to dig on
his land had found a great number of old Roman bronze coins, but,
instead of taking them to him, had kept them, though they cared
so little for them that they gave a handful to a boy whom they
met.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told them,&rdquo; said Tennyson, &ldquo;that
they had been guilty of malappropriation, and though I was not
quite sure whether the coins belonged to me or to the Crown, that
they certainly had no right to them.&nbsp; Whereupon their leader
said that if I was not satisfied they would not work any longer
for me, and so they went away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had on this
occasion a long and interesting discussion with Mr. Tennyson
relative to Walt Whitman, and involving the principles or nature
of poetry.&nbsp; According to the poet-laureate, poetry, as he
understood it, consisted of elevated or refined, or at least
superior thought, expressed in melodious form, and in this latter
it seemed to him (for it was very modestly expressed) that
Whitman was wanting.&nbsp; Wherein he came nearer to the truth
than does Symonds, who overrates, as it seems to me, the value,
as regards art and poetry, of simply <i>equalising</i> all human
intelligences.&nbsp; Though I never met Symonds, there was mutual
knowledge between us, and when I published my
&ldquo;Etrusco-Roman Remains in Popular Traditions,&rdquo; which
contains the results of six years&rsquo; intimacy with witches
and fortune-tellers, he wrote a letter expressing enthusiastic
admiration of it to Mr. T. Fisher Unwin.&nbsp; Now all three of
these great men are dead.&nbsp; I shall speak of Whitman anon,
for in later years for a long time I met him almost daily.</p>
<p>I can remember that during the conversation Tennyson expressed
himself, rather to my amazement, with some slight indignation at
a paltry review abusing his latest work; to which I
replied&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>&ldquo;If there is anything on earth for which I have
envied you, even more than for your great renown as a poet, it
has been because I supposed you were completely above all such
attacks and were utterly indifferent to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
he took amiably, and proceeded to discuss ripe fruit and
wasps&mdash;or their equivalent.&nbsp; Yet I doubt whether I was
quite in the right, since those who live for fame honourably
acquired must ever be susceptible to stings, small or
great.&nbsp; An editor who receives abusive letters so frequently
that he ends by pitching them without reading into the
waste-basket, and often treats ribald attacks in print in the
same manner&mdash;as I have often done&mdash;has so many other
affairs on his mind that he becomes case-hardened.&nbsp; But I
have observed from long experience that there is a Nemesis who
watches those who arrogate the right to lay on the rod, and gives
it to them with interest in the end.</p>
<p>It was very soon after my arrival in London that I was invited
to lunch at Hepworth Dixon&rsquo;s to meet Lord Lytton, or
Bulwer, the great writer.&nbsp; His works had been so intensely
and sympathetically loved by me so long, that it seemed as if I
had been asked to meet some great man of the past.&nbsp; I found
him, as I expected, quite congenial and wondrous kind.&nbsp; I
remember a droll incident.&nbsp; Standing at the head of the
stairs, he courteously made way and asked me to go before.&nbsp;
I replied, &ldquo;When Louis XIV. asked Crillon to do the same,
Crillon complied, saying, &lsquo;Wherever your Majesty goes, be
it before or behind, is always the first place or post of
honour,&rsquo; and I say the same with him,&rdquo; and so went in
advance at once.&nbsp; I saw by his expression that he was
pleased with the quotation.</p>
<p>We were looking at a portrait of Shakespeare which Dixon had
found in Russia.&nbsp; Lord Lytton asked me if I thought it an
original or true likeness.&nbsp; I observed that the face was
full of many fine seamy lines, which infallibly indicate great
nervous genius of the highest order&mdash;noting at the same time
that Lord Lytton&rsquo;s countenance was very much <!-- page
397--><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>marked in a like manner.&nbsp; The observation was new
to him, and he seemed to be interested in it, as he always was in
anything like chiromancy or metoscopy.&nbsp; A few days later I
was invited to come and pass nearly a week with Hepworth Dixon at
Knebworth, Lord Lytton&rsquo;s country seat.&nbsp; It is a very
picturesque <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, profusely adorned with
fifteenth-century Gothic grotesques, with a fine antique hall,
stained glass windows, and gallery.&nbsp; There is in it a
chamber containing a marvellous and massive carved oak bedstead,
the posts of which are human figures the size of life, and in it
and in the same room Queen Elizabeth is said to have slept when
she heard of the destruction of the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; It was
the room of honour, and it had been kindly assigned to me.&nbsp;
It all seemed like a dream.</p>
<p>There was in the family of the late Lord Lytton his son, who
made a most favourable impression on me.&nbsp; I think the first
<i>coup</i> was my finding that he knew the works of Andreini,
and that it had occurred to him as well as to me that Euphues
Lily&rsquo;s book had been modelled on them.&nbsp; There was also
his wife, a magnificent and graceful beauty; Lord Lytton&rsquo;s
nephew, Mr. Bulwer; and several ladies.&nbsp; The first morning
we all fished in the pond, and, to my great amazement, Lord
Lytton pulled out <i>a great one-eyed perch</i>!&nbsp; I almost
expected to see him pull out Paul Clifford or Zanoni next!&nbsp;
In the afternoon we were driven out to Cowper Castle to see a
fine gallery of pictures, our host acting as cicerone, and as he
soon found that I was fairly well educated in art, and had been a
special pupil of Thiersch in Munich, and something more than an
amateur, we had many interesting conversations.&nbsp; I think I
may venture to say that he did <i>not</i> expect to find a whilom
student of &aelig;sthetics, art-history, and Philosophy in the
author of &ldquo;Hans Breitmann.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was delightful
was his exquisite tact in never saying as much; but I could
detect it in the sudden interest and involuntary compliment
implied in his tone of conversation.&nbsp; In a very short time
he began to speak to me on all literary or artistic <!-- page
398--><a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>subjects without preliminary question, taking it for
granted that I understood them and chimed in with him.&nbsp; I
was with every interview more and more impressed with his
<i>culture</i>&mdash;I mean with what had resulted from his
reading&mdash;his marvellous tact of kindness in small things to
all, and his quick and vigorous comparing and contrasting of
images and drawing conclusions.&nbsp; But there was evidently
enough a firm bed-rock or hard pan under all this gold.&nbsp; I
was amazed one day when a footman, who had committed some
<i>b&eacute;vue</i> or blunder, or apprehended something,
actually turned pale and stammered with terror when Lord Lytton
gravely addressed a question to him.&nbsp; I never in my life saw
a man so much frightened, even before a revolver.</p>
<p>But Lord Lytton was beyond all question really interested when
he found me so much at home in Rosicrucian and occult lore, and
that I had been with Justinus Kerner in Weinsberg, and was
familiar with the forgotten dusky paths of mysticism.&nbsp; He
had in his house the famous Earl Stanhope crystal, and wished me
to sleep with it under my pillow, but I was so afraid lest the
precious relic should be injured, that I resolutely declined the
honour, for which I am now sorry, for I sometimes have dreams of
a most extraordinary character.&nbsp; This Stanhope crystal is
not, however, the great mirror of Dr. Dee, though it has been
said to be so.&nbsp; The latter belonged to a gentleman in
London, who also offered to lend it to me.&nbsp; It is made of
cannel coal.&nbsp; That Lord Lytton made a very remarkable
impression on me is proved by the fact that I continued to dream
of him at long intervals after his death; and I am quite sure
that such feeling is, by its very nature, always to a certain
slight degree reciprocal.&nbsp; He had a natural and unaffected
<i>voice</i>, yet one with a marked character; something like
Tennyson&rsquo;s, which was even more striking.&nbsp; Both were
far removed from the now fashionable intonation, which is the
admiration and despair of American swells.&nbsp; It is only the
<i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> form of the <!-- page 399--><a
name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span><i>demnition</i> dialect of the Forties and the
<i>La-ard</i> and <i>Lunnon</i> of an earlier age.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton was generally invisible in the morning, sometimes
after lunch.&nbsp; In the evening he came out splendidly groomed,
fresh as a rose, and at dinner and after was as interesting as
any of his books.&nbsp; He had known &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; to a
surprising extent, and had anecdotes fresh and vivid of every one
whom he had met.&nbsp; He loved music, and there was a lady who
sang old Spanish ballads with rare taste.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself
incredibly.</p>
<p>I may be excused for mentioning here that I sent a copy of the
second edition of my &ldquo;Meister Karl&rsquo;s
Sketch-Book&rdquo; to Lord Lytton.&nbsp; No one but Irving and
Tr&uuml;bner had ever praised it.&nbsp; When Lord Lytton
published afterwards &ldquo;Kenelm Chillingly,&rdquo; I found in
it <i>three</i> passages in which I recognised beyond dispute
others suggested by my own work.&nbsp; I do not in the least mean
that there was <i>any</i> borrowing or taking beyond the mere
suggestion of thought.&nbsp; Why I think that Lord Lytton had
these hints in his mind is that he gave the name of Leland to one
of the minor characters in the book.</p>
<p>When I published a full edition of &ldquo;Breitmann&rsquo;s
Poems,&rdquo; he wrote me a long letter criticising and praising
the work, and a much longer and closely written one, of seven
pages, relating to my &ldquo;Confucius and Other
Poems.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was subsequently invited to receptions at
his house in London, where I first met Browning, and had a long
conversation with him.&nbsp; I saw him afterwards at Mrs.
Proctor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This was the wife of Barry Cornwall, whom
I also saw.&nbsp; He was very old and infirm.&nbsp; I can
remember when the &ldquo;Cornlaw Rhymes&rdquo; rang wherever
English was read.</p>
<p>As I consider it almost a duty to record what I can remember
of Bulwer, I may mention that one evening, at his house in
London, he showed me and others some beautiful old brass salvers
in <i>repouss&eacute;</i> work, and how I astonished him by
describing the process, and declaring that I could produce <!--
page 400--><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>a <i>facsimile</i> of any one of them in a day or two;
to which assertion hundreds to whom I have taught the art, as
well as my &ldquo;Manual of Repouss&eacute;,&rdquo; and another
on &ldquo;Metal Work,&rdquo; will, I trust, bear witness.&nbsp;
And this I mention, not vainly, but because Lord Lytton seemed to
be interested and pleased, and because, in after years, I had
much to do with reviving the practice of this beautiful
art.&nbsp; It was practising this, and a three years&rsquo; study
of oak-wood carving, which led me to write on the Minor
Arts.&nbsp; <i>Mihi &aelig;s et triplex robur</i>.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton had the very curious habit of making almost
invisible hieroglyphics or crosses in his letters&mdash;at least
I found them in those to me, as it were for luck.&nbsp; It was a
very common practice from the most ancient Egyptian times to
within two centuries.&nbsp; Lord Lytton&rsquo;s were evidently
intended to escape observation.&nbsp; But there was indeed a
great deal in his character which would escape most persons, and
which has not been revealed by any writer on him.&nbsp; This I
speedily divined, though, of course, I never discovered what it
all was.</p>
<p>Lord Houghton, &ldquo;Richard Monckton Milnes,&rdquo; to whom
I had a letter of introduction from Lorimer Graham, was very kind
to me.&nbsp; I dined and lunched at his house, where I met Odo
Russell or Lord Ampthill, the Duke of Bedford, the Hon. Mrs.
Norton, W. W. Story, and I know not how many more distinguished
in society, or letters.&nbsp; At Lord Lytton&rsquo;s I made the
acquaintance of the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; I believe, however,
that this meeting with Lord Houghton and the Duke was in my
second year in London.</p>
<p>The first English garden-party which I ever attended was
during this first season, at the villa of Mr. Bohn, the
publisher, at Twickenham.&nbsp; There I made the acquaintance of
George Cruikshank, whom I afterwards met often, and knew very
well till his death.&nbsp; He was a gay old fellow, and on this
occasion danced a jig with old Mr. Bohn on the lawn, and joked
with me.&nbsp; There, too, we met Lady Martin, who had been the
famed Helen Faucit.&nbsp; Cruikshank was always <!-- page
401--><a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>inexhaustible in jokes, anecdotes, and
reminiscences.&nbsp; At his house I made the acquaintance of Miss
Ada Cavendish.</p>
<p>To revert to Mr. Tr&uuml;bner&rsquo;s, I may say that one
evening after dinner, when, genial though quiet, Bret Harte was
one of the guests, he was asked to repeat the &ldquo;Heathen
Chinee,&rdquo; which he could not do, as he had never learned
it&mdash;which is not such an unusual thing, by the way, as many
suppose.&nbsp; But I, who knew it, remarked, &ldquo;Ladies and
gentlemen, it is nothing to merely <i>write</i> a poem.&nbsp;
True genius consists in getting it by or from heart [<i>from</i>
Bret Harte, for instance], and repeating it.&nbsp; This genius
nature has denied to the illustrious poet before you&mdash;but
not to me, as I will now illustrate by declaiming the
&lsquo;Heathen Chinee.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Which performance was
received with applause, in which Harte heartily joined.&nbsp; But
my claim to possess genius would hardly have borne examination,
for it was years before I ever learned &ldquo;Hans
Breitmann&rsquo;s Barty,&rdquo; nor would I like to risk even a
pound to one hundred that I can do it now without mixing the
verses or committing some error.</p>
<p>Once during the season I went with my wife and Mr. W. W. Story
to Eton, where we supped with Oscar Browning.&nbsp; We were taken
out boating on the river, and I enjoyed it very much.&nbsp; There
is a romance about the Thames associated with a thousand passages
in literature which goes to the very heart.&nbsp; I was much
impressed by the marked character of Mr. Browning and his frank,
genial nature; and I found some delightful old Latin books in his
library.&nbsp; May I meet with many such men!</p>
<p>This year, what with the German war and the
Tr&uuml;bner-Hotten controversy, my &ldquo;Breitmann
Ballads&rdquo; had become, I may say, well known.&nbsp; The
character of Hans was actually brought into plays on three stages
at once.&nbsp; Boucicault, whom I knew well of yore in America,
introduced it into something.&nbsp; I had found Ewan
Colquhoun&mdash;the same old sixpence&mdash;and one night he took
me to the Strand Theatre to see a play in which my hero was a
prominent part.&nbsp; I was <!-- page 402--><a
name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>told
afterwards that the company having been informed of my presence,
all came to look at me through the curtain-hole.&nbsp; There were
some imitations of my ballads published in <i>Punch</i> and the
<i>Standard</i>, and the latter were so admirably
executed&mdash;pardon the vain word!&mdash;that I feared, because
they satirised the German cause, that they might be credited to
me; therefore I wrote to the journal, begging that the author
would give some indication that I had not written them, which was
kindly done.&nbsp; Finally, a newspaper was started called
<i>Hans Breitmann</i>, and the Messrs. Cope, of Liverpool, issued
a brand of Hans Breitmann cigars.&nbsp; Owing to the resemblance
between the words Bret and Breit there was a confusion of names,
and my photograph was to be seen about town, with the name of
Bret Harte attached to it.&nbsp; This great injustice to Mr.
Harte was not agreeable, and I, or my friends, remonstrated with
the shop-folk with the to-be-expected result, &ldquo;Yes-sir,
yes-sir&mdash;very sorry, sir&mdash;we&rsquo;ll correct the
mistake, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think it was ever
corrected till the sale ceased.</p>
<p>I was sometimes annoyed with many imitations of my poems by
persons who knew no German, which were all attributed to
me.&nbsp; A very pious Presbyterian publication, in alluding to
something of the kind, said that &ldquo;Mr. Leland, <i>because he
is the author of Bret Harte</i>, thinks himself justified in
publishing any trash of this description.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought
this a <i>very</i> improper allusion for a clergyman, not to say
libellous.&nbsp; In fact, many people really believed that Bret
Harte was a <i>nom de plume</i> or the title of a poem.&nbsp; And
I may here say by the way that I never &ldquo;wrote under&rdquo;
the pseudonym of Hans Breitmann in my life, nor called myself any
such name at any time.&nbsp; It is simply the name of one of many
<i>books</i> which I have written.&nbsp; An American once
insisting to me that I <i>should</i> be called so from my work, I
asked him if he would familiarly accost Mr. Lowell as &ldquo;Josh
Biglow.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there is anything in the world which
denotes a subordinate position in the social scale or defect in
education, it is the <!-- page 403--><a name="page403"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 403</span>passion to call men &ldquo;out of
their names,&rdquo; and never feel really acquainted with any one
until he is termed Tom or Jack.&nbsp; It is doubtless all very
genial and jocose and sociable, but the man who shows a tendency
to it should <i>not</i> complain when his betters put him in a
lower class or among the &ldquo;lower orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once at a reception at George Boughton&rsquo;s, the artist,
there was, as I heard, an elderly gentleman rushing about asking
to see or be introduced to <i>Hart Bretmann</i>, whose works he
declared he knew by heart, and with whom he was most anxious to
become acquainted.&nbsp; Whether he ever discovered this
remarkable conglomerate I do not know.</p>
<p>I once made the acquaintance of an American at the Langham
Hotel who declared that I had made life a burden to him.&nbsp;
His name was H. Brightman, and being in business in New York, he
never went to the Custom-House or Post-Office but what the clerks
cried &ldquo;Hans Brightman! of course.&nbsp; Yes, we have read
about you, sir&mdash;in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even in this London season I found more serious work to
attend to than comic ballads or society.&nbsp; Mr. Tr&uuml;bner
was very anxious to have me write a pamphlet vindicating the
claim of Germany to Alsace and Lorraine, and I offered to do it
gladly, if he would provide all the historical data or
material.&nbsp; The result of this was the <i>brochure</i>
entitled &ldquo;France, Alsace, and Lorraine,&rdquo; which had a
great success.&nbsp; It at once reappeared in America, and even
in Spanish in South America.&nbsp; The German Minister in London
ordered six copies, and the <i>Times</i> made the work, with all
its facts and figures, into an editorial article, omitting, I
regret to say, to mention the source whence it was derived; but
this I forgive with all my heart, considering the good words
which it has given me on other occasions.&nbsp; For the object of
the work was not at all to glorify the author, but to send home
great truths at a very critical time; and the article in the
<i>Times</i>, which was little else but my pamphlet condensed,
caused a great sensation.&nbsp; But the principal result from it
was this: <!-- page 404--><a name="page404"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 404</span>I had in the work discussed the
idea, then urged by the French and their friends, that, to avoid
driving France to &ldquo;desperation,&rdquo; very moderate terms
should be accepted in order to conciliate.&nbsp; For the French,
as I observed in effect, will do their <i>very worst in any
case</i>, and every possible extreme should be anticipated and
assumed.&nbsp; This same argument had previously been urged in my
&ldquo;Centralisation <i>versus</i> States Rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Prince Bismarck conversed with the French Commissioners
to arrange terms of peace, he met this argument of not driving
the French to extremes with a phrase so closely like the one
which I had used in my pamphlet, that neither Mr. Tr&uuml;bner
nor several others hesitated to declare to me that it was beyond
all question taken from it.&nbsp; Bismarck had <i>certainly</i>
received the pamphlet, which had been recognised by the
<i>Times</i>, and in many other quarters, as a more than ordinary
paper, and Prince Bismarck, like all great diplomatists, <i>prend
son bien o&ugrave; il le trouve</i>.&nbsp; In any case this
remains true, that that which formed the settling argument of
Germany, found at the time expression in my pamphlet and in the
Chancellor&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>We made soon after a visit to the Rev. Dean and Mrs.
Carrington, in Bocking, Essex.&nbsp; They had a fair daughter,
Eva, then quite a girl, who has since become well known as a
writer, and is now the Countess Cesaresco Martinengro&mdash;an
Italian name, and not Romany-Gypsy, as its terminations would
seem to indicate.&nbsp; There is in the village of Bocking, at a
corner, a curious and very large grotesque figure of oak, which
was evidently in the time of Elizabeth a pilaster in some
house-front.&nbsp; My friend Edwards, who was wont to roam all
over England in a mule-waggon etching and sketching, when in
Bocking was informed by a rustic that this figure was the image
of Harkil&eacute;s (Hercules), a heathen god formerly worshipped
in the old Catholic convent upon the hill, in the old times!</p>
<p>From London we went in August, 1870, to Brighton, staying <!--
page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>at first at the Albion Hotel.&nbsp; There, under the
influence of fresh sea-air, long walks and drives in all the
country round, I began to feel better, yet it was not for many
weeks that I fairly recovered.&nbsp; A chemist named Phillips,
who supplied me with bromide of potass, suggested to me, to his
own loss, that I took a great deal too much.&nbsp; I left it off
altogether, substituting pale ale.&nbsp; Finding this far better,
I asked Mr. Phillips if he could not prepare for me
<i>lupulin</i>, or the anodyne of hops.&nbsp; He laughed, and
said, &ldquo;Do you find the result required in ale?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you like
ale?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you <i>drink</i>
ale?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I did, but before I took it up my very
vitality seemed to be well-nigh exhausted with the bromide.</p>
<p>Samuel Laing, M.P., the chairman of the Brighton Railway, had
at that time a house in Brighton, with several sons and
daughters, the latter of whom have all been very remarkable for
beauty and accomplishments.&nbsp; In this home there was a
hospitality so profuse, so kind, so brilliant and refined, that I
cannot really remember to have ever seen it equalled, and as we
fully participated in it at all times in every form, I should
feel that I had omitted the deepest claim to my gratitude if I
did not here acknowledge it.&nbsp; Mr. Laing was or is of a stock
which deeply appealed to my sympathies, for he is the son of the
famous translator of the <i>Heimskringla</i>, a great collection
of Norse sagas, which I had read, and in which he himself
somewhat aided.&nbsp; Of late years, since he has retired from
more active financial business, Mr. Laing has not merely turned
his attention to literature; he has deservedly distinguished
himself by translating, as I may say, into the clearest and most
condensed or succinct and lucid English ever written, so as to be
understood by the humblest mind, the doctrines of Darwin, Huxley,
and the other leading scientific minds of the day.&nbsp; Heine in
his time received a great deal of credit for having thus acted as
the flux and furnace by which the ore of German philosophy was
<!-- page 406--><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
406</span>smelted into pure gold for general circulation; but I,
who have translated all that Heine wrote on this subject, declare
that he was at such work as far inferior to Samuel Laing as a
mere verbal description of a beautiful face is inferior to a
first-class portrait.&nbsp; This family enters so largely into my
reminiscences and experiences, that a chapter would hardly
suffice to express all that I can recall of their hospitality for
years, of the dinners, hunts, balls, excursions, and the many
distinguished people whom I have met under their roof.&nbsp; It
is worth noting of Mr. Laing&rsquo;s daughters, that Mary, now
Mrs. Kennard, is at the head of the sporting-novel writers; that
the beautiful Cecilia, now Mrs. MacRae, was pronounced by G. H.
Lewes, who was no mean judge, to be the first amateur pianiste in
England; while the charming &ldquo;Floy,&rdquo; or Mrs. Kennedy,
is a very able painter.&nbsp; With their two very pretty sisters,
they formed in 1870 as brilliant, beautiful, and accomplished a
quintette as England could have produced.</p>
<p>One day Mr. Laing organised an excursion with a special train
to Arundel Castle.&nbsp; By myself at other times I found my way
to Lewes and other places rich in legendary lore.&nbsp; Of this
latter I recall something worth telling.&nbsp; Harold, the
conquered Saxon king, had a son, and the conqueror William had a
daughter, Gundrada.&nbsp; The former became a Viking pirate, and
in his old age a monk, and was buried in a church, now a
Presbyterian chapel.&nbsp; There his epitaph may be read in fine
bold lettering, still distinct.&nbsp; That man is dear to me.</p>
<p>Gundrada married, died, and was buried in a church with a fine
Norman tombstone over her remains.&nbsp; The church was levelled
with the ground, but the slab was preserved here and there about
Lewes as a relic.&nbsp; When the railway was built, about 1849,
there was discovered, where the church had been, the bones of
Gundrada and her husband in leaden coffins distinctly inscribed
with their names.&nbsp; A very beautiful Norman chapel was then
built to receive the <!-- page 407--><a name="page407"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 407</span>coffins, and over them is placed the
original memorial in black marble.&nbsp; There is also in Lewes
an arch&aelig;ological museum appropriately bestowed in an old
Gothic tower.&nbsp; All of which things did greatly solace
me.&nbsp; As did also the Norman or Gothic churches of Shoreham,
Newport, the old manor of Rottingdean, and the marvellous
Devil&rsquo;s Dyke, which was probably a Roman fort, and from
which it is said that fifty towns or villages may be seen
&ldquo;far in the blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day I went with my wife and two ladies to visit the
latter.&nbsp; The living curiosity of the place was a famous old
gypsy woman named Gentilla Cooper, a pure blood or real
<i>Kalorat</i> Romany.&nbsp; I had already in America studied
Pott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus of Gypsy Dialects,&rdquo; and
picked up many phrases of the tongue from the works of Borrow,
Simson, and others.&nbsp; The old dame tackled us at once.&nbsp;
As soon as I could, I whispered in her ear an improvised
rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The bashno and
k&#257;ni,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rye and the r&#257;ni,<br />
Hav&rsquo;d akai &rsquo;pr&eacute; o boro lon
p&#257;ni.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means that the cock and the hen, the gentleman and the
lady, came hither across the great salt water.&nbsp; The effect
on the gypsy was startling; she fairly turned pale.&nbsp;
Hustling the ladies away to one side to see a beautiful view, she
got me alone and hurriedly exclaimed,
&ldquo;<i>Rya</i>&mdash;master! <i>be</i> you one of our
people?&rdquo; with much more.&nbsp; We became very good friends,
and this little incident had in time for me great results, and
many strange experiences of gypsy life.</p>
<p>There live in Brighton two ladies, Miss Horace Smith and her
sister Rosa, who were and are well known in the cultured
world.&nbsp; They are daughters of Horace Smith, who, with his
brother James, wrote the &ldquo;Rejected Addresses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their reminiscences of distinguished men are extremely varied and
interesting.&nbsp; The elder sister possesses an album to which
Thackeray contributed many verses and pen-sketches.&nbsp; <!--
page 408--><a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>Their weekly receptions were very pleasant; at them
might be seen most of the literary or social celebrities who came
to Brighton.&nbsp; A visit there was like living a chapter in a
book of memoirs and reminiscences.&nbsp; I have had, if it be
only a quiet, and not very eventful or remarkable, at least a
somewhat varied life, and the Laings and Smiths, with their
surroundings, form two of its most interesting varieties.&nbsp; I
believe they never missed an opportunity to do us or any one a
kindly act, to aid us to make congenial friends, or the
like.&nbsp; How many good people there really are in the
world!</p>
<p>Of these ladies the author of &ldquo;Gossip of the
Century&rdquo; writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Horace Smith&rsquo;s two daughters are
still living, and in Brighton.&nbsp; Their very pleasant house is
frequented by the best and most interesting kind of society,
affording what may be called a <i>salon</i>, that rare relic of
ancient literary taste and cementer of literary
intimacies&mdash;a salon which the cultivated consider it a
privilege to frequent, and where these ladies receive with a
grace and geniality which their friends know how to
appreciate.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted that gatherings of
this description seem to be becoming rarer every year, for as
death disturbs them society seems to lack the spirit or the good
taste, or the ability, to replace them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brighton is a very pleasant place, because it combines the
advantages of a seaside resort with those of a clean and cheerful
city.&nbsp; Walking along the front, you have a brave outlook to
the blue sea on one hand, and elegant shop-windows and fine
hotels on the other.&nbsp; A little back in the town on a hill is
the fine old fifteenth-century church of St. Nicholas, in which
there is perhaps the most curious carved Norman font in England;
but all this is known to so few visitors, that I feel as if I
were telling a great secret in letting it out.&nbsp;
Smith&rsquo;s book-store on the Western Road, and Bohn&rsquo;s
near the station, are kept by very well-informed and very
courteous men.&nbsp; I have been much indebted to the former <!--
page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

needed and rare work.</p>
<p>When I first went to Brighton there was one evening a
brilliant aurora borealis.&nbsp; As I looked at it, I heard an
Englishman say, to my great amazement, it was the first time he
had ever seen one in his life!&nbsp; I once saw one in America of
such extraordinary brilliancy and duration, that it prolonged the
daylight for half an hour or more, till I became amazed, and then
found it was a Northern Light.&nbsp; It lasted till sunrise in
all its splendour.&nbsp; I have taken down from Algonkin Indians
several beautiful legends relating to them.&nbsp; In one, the
Milky Way is the girdle of a stupendous deity, and the Northern
Lights the splendid gleams emitted by his ball when
playing.&nbsp; In another, the narrator describes him as clad in
an ineffable glory of light, and in colours unknown on earth!</p>
<p>And this reminds me further that I have just read in the
newspapers of the death of Edwin Booth, who was born during the
famous star shower of 1833, which phenomenon I witnessed from
beginning to end, and remember as if it were only
yesterday.&nbsp; Now, I was actually dreaming that I was in a
room in which <i>cigars</i> were flying about in every direction,
when my father came and woke me and my brother Henry, to come and
see an exceeding great marvel.&nbsp; There were for a long time
many thousands of stars at once in the sky, all shooting, as it
were, or converging towards a centre.&nbsp; They were not half so
long as the meteors which we see; one or two had a crook or bend
in the middle, <i>e.g.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p409.jpg">
<img alt="The meteor pattern" src="images/p409.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The next day I was almost alone at school in the glory of
having seen it, for so few people were awake in sober
Philadelphia at three in the morning that one of the newspapers
ridiculed the whole story.</p>
<p>I can distinctly recall that the next day, at Mr.
Alcott&rsquo;s, I read through a very favourite work of mine, a
translation of the German <i>Das M&auml;hrchen ohne
Ende</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The Story without an End.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 410--><a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>All kinds of odd fish came to Brighton, floating here
and there; but two of the very oddest were encountered by me in
it on my last visit.&nbsp; I was looking into a chemist&rsquo;s
window, when two well-dressed and decidedly jolly feminines, one
perhaps of thirty years, and the other much younger and quite
pretty, paused by me, while the elder asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you looking for a hair-restorer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, though I fear I need one much more than you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The search for a good hair-restorer,&rdquo; she replied
in Italian, &ldquo;is as vain as the search for
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; I answered in the same tongue, &ldquo;and
unless you have the happiness in you, or a beautiful head of hair
like yours already growing on you, you will find
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we <i>forget</i>,&rdquo; added the younger in
Spanish, &ldquo;is the best part of our happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;orita</i>, <i>parece que no ha olvidado su
Espa&ntilde;ol</i>&mdash;The young lady appears not to have
forgotten her Spanish&mdash;I replied.&nbsp; (Mine is not very
good.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use asking whether <i>you</i> talk
French,&rdquo; said the elder.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>K&ouml;nnen Sie
auch Deutsch sprechen</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ja wohl</i>!&nbsp; Even worse than German
itself,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>Just then there came up to us a gypsy girl whom I knew, with a
basket of flowers, and asked me in Gypsy to buy some; but I said,
&ldquo;<i>Parraco pen</i>, <i>j&#257; vr&#299;</i>, <i>mandy
k&#257;ms kek ruzhia ked&iacute;vvus</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Thank you,
sister, no flowers to-day&mdash;and she darted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you understand <i>that</i>?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gitano</i>&mdash;gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; cried the girl,
&ldquo;could she <i>know</i> that <i>you</i> spoke
Gitano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am,&rdquo; I replied slowly and grimly,
&ldquo;the chief of all the gypsies in England, the <i>boro
Romany rye</i> and President of the Gypsy Society.&nbsp;

<p>At this appalling announcement, which sounded like an extract
from a penny dreadful, my two romantic friends looked absolutely
bewildered.&nbsp; They seemed as if they had read in novels how
mysterious gypsy chiefs cast aside their cloaks, revealing
themselves to astonished maidens, and as I had actually spoken
Gitano to a gypsy in their hearing, it must be so.&nbsp; They had
come for wool with all their languages, poor little souls! and
gone back shorn.&nbsp; The elder said something about their
having just come to Brighton for six hours&rsquo; frolic, and so
they departed.&nbsp; They had had their spree.</p>
<p>I have often wondered what under the sun they could have
been.&nbsp; Attach&eacute;s of an opera
company&mdash;ladies&rsquo;-maids who had made the grand
tour&mdash;who knows?&nbsp; A mad world, my masters!</p>
<p>I can recall of that first year, as of many since at Brighton,
long breezy walks on the brow of the chalk cliffs, looking out at
the blue sea white capped, or at the downs rolling inland to
Newport, sometimes alone, at times in company.&nbsp; On all this
chalk the grass does not grow to more than an inch or so in
length, and as the shortest, tenderest food is best for sheep, it
is on this that they thrive&mdash;I believe by
millions&mdash;yielding the famous South Downs mutton.&nbsp; In
or on this grass are incredible numbers of minute snails, which
the sheep are said to devour; in fact, I do not see how they
could eat the grass without taking them in, and these contribute
to give the mutton its delicate flavour.&nbsp; Snails are curious
beings.&nbsp; Being epicene, they conduct their wooings on the
mutual give and take principle, which would save human beings a
great deal of spasmodic flirtation, and abolish the whole
<i>femme incomprise</i> business, besides a great many bad
novels, if we could adopt it.&nbsp; When winter comes,
half-a-dozen of them retire into a hole in a bank, connect
themselves firmly into a loving band like a bunch of grapes by
the tenderest ties, and <!-- page 412--><a
name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>stay there
till spring.&nbsp; Finally, in folk-lore the snail is an uncanny
or demoniac being, because it has horns.&nbsp; Its shell is an
amulet, and the presentation of one by a lady to a gentleman is a
very decided declaration of love, especially in Germany.&nbsp;
<i>Sed mittamus h&aelig;c</i>.</p>
<p>At this time, and for some time to come, I was engaged in
collecting and correcting a book of poems of a more serious
character than the &ldquo;Breitmann Ballads.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was &ldquo;The Music Lesson of Confucius and other
Poems.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of which book I can say truly that it had a
<i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>, though it had a very small
sale.&nbsp; There were in it ten or twelve ballads only which
were adapted to singing, and <i>all</i> of these were set to
music by Carlo Pinsutti, Virginia Gabriel, or others.&nbsp; There
was in it a poem entitled &ldquo;On Mount Meru.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this the Creator is supposed to show the world when it was first
made to Satan.&nbsp; The adversary finds that all is fit and
well, save &ldquo;the being called Man,&rdquo; who seems to him
to be the worst and most incongruous.&nbsp; To which the
Demiurgus replies that Man will in the end conquer all things,
even the devil himself.&nbsp; And at the last the demon lies
dying at the feet of God, and confesses that &ldquo;Man, thy
creature hath vanquished me for ever&mdash;<i>Vicisti
Galil&aelig;e</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Some years after I read a work by
a French writer in which this same idea of God and the devil is
curiously carried out and illustrated by the history of
architecture.&nbsp; And as in the case of the letter from Lord
Lytton Bulwer, warm praise from other persons of high rank in the
literary world and reviews, I had many proofs that these poems
had made a favourable impression.&nbsp; The only exception which
I can recall was a very sarcastic review in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, in which the writer declared his belief
that the poems or Legends of Perfumes in the book were originally
written as advertisements of some barber or tradesman, and being
by him rejected as worthless, had been thrown back on my
hands!&nbsp; Other works by me it treated kindly&mdash;so it goes
in this world&mdash;like a recipe for a cement which I have just
copied into my great work on &ldquo;Mending <!-- page 413--><a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>and
Repairing&rdquo;&mdash;in which vinegar is combined with
sugar.</p>
<p>While at Brighton we met Louis Blanc, whom we had previously
seen several times at the Tr&uuml;bners&rsquo;, in London.&nbsp;
In Brighton he heard the news of the overthrow of the Empire and
departed for Paris.&nbsp; At Christmas we went to London to visit
the Tr&uuml;bners, and thence to the Langham Hotel, where we
remained till July.&nbsp; I recall very little of what I
witnessed or did beyond seeing the Queen prorogue Parliament and
translating Scheffel&rsquo;s <i>Gaudeamus</i>, a little volume of
German humorous poems.&nbsp; Scheffel, as I have before written,
was an old <i>Mitkneipant</i>, or evening-beer companion of mine
in Heidelberg.</p>
<p>In July we made up a travelling party with Mrs. S. Laing and
her daughters Cecilia and Floy, and departed for a visit to the
Rhine&mdash;that is to say, these ladies preceded us, and we
joined them at the Hotel des Quatre Saisons in Homburg.&nbsp; It
was a very brilliant season, for the German Emperor, fresh with
the glory of his great victory, was being <i>f&ecirc;ted</i>
everywhere, and Homburg the brilliant was not behind the German
world in this respect.&nbsp; I saw the great man frequently, near
and far, and was much impressed with his appearance.&nbsp;
<i>Punch</i> had not long before represented him as Hans
Breitmann in a cartoon, deploring that he had not squeezed more
milliards out of the French, and I indeed found in the original
very closely my ideal of Hans, who always occurs to me as a
German gentleman, who drinks, fights, and plunders, not as a mere
rowdy, raised above his natural sphere, but as a rough
cavalier.&nbsp; And that the great-bearded giant Emperor Wilhelm
did drink heavily, fight hard, and mulct France mightily, is
matter of history.&nbsp; This was the last year of the
gaming-tables at Homburg.&nbsp; Apropos of these, the
roulette-table was placed in the Homburg Museum, where it may be
seen amid many Roman relics.&nbsp; Two or three years ago, while
I was in the room, there came in a small party of English or
Yankee looking or gazing tourists, to whom the attendant <!--
page 414--><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
414</span>pointed out the roulette-table.&nbsp; &ldquo;And did
the old Romans really play at roulette, and was <i>that</i> one
of their tables?&rdquo; said the leader of the visitors.&nbsp;
This ready simple faith indicates the Englishman.&nbsp; The
ordinary American is always possessed with the conviction that
everything antique is a forgery.&nbsp; Once when I was examining
the old Viking armour in the Museum of Copenhagen, a Yankee, in
whose face a general vulgar distrust of all earthly things was
strongly marked, came up to me and asked, &ldquo;Do you believe
that all these curiosities air <i>genooine</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; With an intensely
self-satisfied air he rejoined, &ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t
fool <i>me</i> with no such humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a great deal of cholera that year in Germany, and I
had a very severe attack of it either in an incipient form or
something thereunto allied: suffice it to say that for twelve
hours I almost thought I should die of pure pain.&nbsp; I took in
vain laudanum, cayenne pepper, brandy, camphor, and
kino&mdash;nothing would remain.&nbsp; At last, at midnight, when
I was beginning to despair, or just as I felt like being wrecked,
I succeeded in keeping a little weak laudanum and water on my
stomach, and then the point was cleared.&nbsp; After that I took
the other remedies, and was soon well.&nbsp; But it was a crisis
of such fearful suffering that it all remains vividly impressed
on my memory.&nbsp; I do not know whether any sensible book has
ever been written on the moral influence of pain, but it is
certain that a wonderful one might be.&nbsp; So far as I can
understand it, I think that in the vast majority of cases it is
an evil, or one of Nature&rsquo;s innumerable mistakes or
divagations, not as yet outgrown or corrected; and it is the
great error of Buddhistic-Christianity that it <i>accepts</i>
pain not merely as inevitable, but glorifies and increases it,
instead of making every conceivable exertion to <i>diminish</i>
it.&nbsp; Herein clearly lies the difference between Science and
Religion.&nbsp; Science strives in every way to alleviate pain
and suffering; erroneous &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; is based on
it.&nbsp; During the Middle Ages, the Church did all in its power
to hinder, if not destroy, the <!-- page 415--><a
name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>healing
art.&nbsp; It made anatomy of the human body a crime, and carried
its precautions so far that, quite till the Reformation, the art
of healing (as Paracelsus declares) was chiefly in the hands of
witches and public executioners.&nbsp; <i>Torturers</i>, chiefly
clergymen such as Grillandus, were in great honour, while the
healing leech was disreputable.&nbsp; It was not, as people say,
&ldquo;the age&rdquo; which caused all this&mdash;it was the
result of religion based on crucifixion and martyrdoms and
pain&mdash;in fact, on that element of <i>torture</i> which we
are elsewhere taught, most inconsistently, is the special
province of the devil in hell.&nbsp; The <i>cant</i> of this
still survives in Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Suffer and be
strong,&rdquo; and in the pious praise of endurance of
pain.&nbsp; What the world wants is the hope held out to it, or
enforced on it as a religion or conviction, that pain and
suffering are to be diminished, and that our chief duty should
consist in diminishing them, instead of always praising or
worshipping them as a cross!</p>
<p>We left our friends and went for a short time to Switzerland,
where we visited Lucerne, Interlaken, Basle, and Berne.&nbsp;
Thence we returned to London and the Langham Hotel.&nbsp; This
was at that time under the management of Mr. John Sanderson, an
American, whom I had known of old.&nbsp; He was a brother of
Professor Sanderson, of Philadelphia, who wrote a remarkably
clever work entitled <i>The American in Paris</i>.&nbsp; John
Sanderson himself had contributed many articles to
Appletons&rsquo; <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, belonged to the New
York Century Club, and, like all the members of his family, had
culture in music and literary taste.&nbsp; While he managed the
Langham it was crowded during all the year, as indeed any decent
hotel almost anywhere may be by simple proper liberal
management.&nbsp; This is a subject which I have studied <i>au
fond</i>, having read <i>Das Hotel wesen der Gegenwart</i>, a
very remarkable work, and passed more than twenty years of my
life in hotels in all countries.</p>
<p>I can remember that during the first year of my residence in
England I tried to persuade a chemist to import from <!-- page
416--><a name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
416</span>South America the <i>coca</i> leaf, of which not an
ounce was then consumed in Europe.&nbsp; Weston the walker
brought it into fashion &ldquo;later on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had heard
extraordinary and authentic accounts of its enabling Indian
messengers to run all day from a friend who had employed
them.&nbsp; Apropos of this, &ldquo;I do recall a wondrous
pleasant tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; My cousin, Godfrey Davenport, a son
of the Uncle Seth mentioned in my earlier life, owned what was
regarded as the model plantation of Louisiana.&nbsp; My brother
Henry visited him one winter, and while there was kindly treated
by a very genial, hospitable neighbouring planter, whom I
afterwards met at my father&rsquo;s house in Philadelphia.&nbsp;
He was a good-looking, finely-formed man, lithe and active as a
panther&mdash;the <i>replica</i> of Albert Pike&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fine Arkansas gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here I would
fain disquisit on Pike, but type and time are pressing.&nbsp;
Well, this gentleman had one day a difference of opinion with
another planter, who was, like himself, a great runner, and
drawing his bowie knife, pursued him on the run, <i>twenty-two
miles</i>, ere he &ldquo;got&rdquo; his victim.&nbsp; The
distance was subsequently measured and verified by the admiring
neighbours, who put up posts in commemoration of such an
unparalleled pedestrian feat.</p>
<p>When I returned to Brighton, after getting into lodgings, I
began to employ or amuse myself in novel fashion.&nbsp; Old
Gentilla Cooper, the gypsy, had an old brother named Matthias, a
full-blood Romany, of whom all his people spoke as being very
eccentric and wild, but who had all his life a fancy for picking
up the old &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; tongue.&nbsp; I engaged him to
come to me two or three times a week, at half-a-crown a visit, to
give me lessons in it.&nbsp; As he had never lived in houses,
and, like Regnar Lodbrog, had never slept under a fixed roof,
unless when he had taken a nap in a tavern or stable, and
finally, as his whole life had been utterly that of a gypsy in
the roads, at fairs, or &ldquo;by wood and wold as outlaws wont
to do,&rdquo; I found him abundantly original and
interesting.&nbsp; And as on account of his eccentricity and
amusing <!-- page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 417</span>gifts he had always been welcome in
every camp or tent, and was watchful withal and crafty, there was
not a phase, hole, or corner of gypsy life or a member of the
fraternity with which or whom he was not familiar.&nbsp; I soon
learned his jargon, with every kind of gypsy device, dodge, or
peculiar custom, and, with the aid of several works, succeeded in
drawing from the recesses of his memory an astonishing number of
forgotten words.&nbsp; Thus, to begin with, I read to him aloud
the Turkish Gypsy Dictionary of Paspati.&nbsp; When he remembered
or recognised a word, or it recalled another, I wrote it
down.&nbsp; Then I went through the vocabularies of Liebrich,
Pott, Simson, &amp;c., and finally through Brice&rsquo;s
Hindustani Dictionary and the great part of a much larger work,
and one in Persian.&nbsp; The reader may find most of the results
of Matty&rsquo;s teaching in my work entitled &ldquo;The English
Gypsies and their Language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very often I went with
my professor to visit the gypsies camped about Brighton, far or
near, and certainly never failed to amuse myself and pick up many
quaint observations.&nbsp; In due time I passed to that singular
state when I could never walk a mile or two in the country
anywhere without meeting or making acquaintance with some
wanderer on the highways, by use of my newly-acquired
knowledge.&nbsp; Thus, I needed only say, &ldquo;Seen any of the
Coopers or Bosvilles lately on the drum?&rdquo; (road), or
&ldquo;Do you know Sam Smith?&rdquo; &amp;c., to be recognised as
one of the grand army in some fashion.&nbsp; Then it was widely
rumoured that the Coopers had got a <i>rye</i>, or master, who
spoke Romany, and was withal not ungenerous, so that in due time
there was hardly a wanderer of gypsy kind in Southern England who
had not heard of me.&nbsp; And though there are thousands of
people who are more thoroughly versed in Society than I am, I do
not think there are many so much at home in such extremely
<i>varied</i> phases of it as I have been.&nbsp; I have sat in a
gypsy camp, like one of them, hearing all their little secrets
and talking familiarly in Romany, and an hour after dined with
distinguished people; and this life had many <!-- page 418--><a
name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 418</span>other
variations, and they came daily for many years.&nbsp; My gypsy
experiences have not been so great as those of Francis H. Groome
(once a pupil and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Benfey), or the
Grand Duke Josef of Hungary, or of Dr. Wlislocki, but next after
these great masters, and as an all-round gypsy rye in many lands,
I believe that I am not far behind any <i>aficionado</i> who has
as yet manifested himself.</p>
<p>To become intimate, as I did in time, during years in
Brighton, off and on, with all the gypsies who roamed the south
of England, to be beloved of the old fortune-tellers and the
children and mothers as I was, and to be much in tents, involves
a great deal of strangely picturesque rural life, night-scenes by
firelight, in forests and by river-banks, and marvellously odd
reminiscences of other days.&nbsp; There was a gypsy child who
knew me so well that the very first words she could speak were
&ldquo;<i>O &rsquo;omany &rsquo;i</i>&rdquo; (O Romany rye), to
the great delight of her parents.</p>
<p>After a little while I found that the <i>Romany</i> element
was spread strangely and mysteriously round about among the rural
population in many ways.&nbsp; I went one day with Francis H.
Groome to Cobham Fair.&nbsp; As I was about to enter a tavern,
there stood near by three men whose faces and general appearance
had nothing of the gypsy, but as I passed one said to the other
so that I could hear&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dikk adovo rye</i>, <i>se o Romany rye</i>,
<i>yuv</i>, <i>t&agrave;cho</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Look at that
gentleman; he is a gypsy gentleman, sure!)</p>
<p>I naturally turned my head hearing this, when he burst out
laughing, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d make him look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once I was startled at hearing a well-dressed, I may say a
gentlemanly-looking man, seated in a gig with a fine horse
stopping by the road, say, as I passed with my wife&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dikk adovo gorgio adoi</i>!&rdquo; (Look at that
Gentile, of no-gypsy!)</p>
<p>Not being accustomed to hear myself called a <i>gorgio</i>, I
glanced up at him angrily, when he, perceiving that I understood
<!-- page 419--><a name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
419</span>him and was of the mysterious brotherhood, smiled, and
touched his hat to me.&nbsp; One touch of nature makes the whole
world grin.</p>
<p>But the drollest proposal ever made to me in serious earnest
came from that indomitable incarnate old <i>gypssissimus
Tsingarorum</i>, Matthew Cooper, who proposed that I should buy a
donkey.&nbsp; He knew where to get one for a pound, but &pound;2
10s. would buy a &ldquo;stunner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would borrow a
small cart and a tent, and brown my face and hands so that I
would be dark enough, and then on the
<i>drum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;over the hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for all
the expenses of the journey, I need not spend anything, for he
could provide a neat nut-brown maid, who would not only do all
our cooking, but earn money enough by fortune-telling to support
us all.&nbsp; I would be expected, however, to greatly aid by my
superior knowledge of ladies and gentlemen; and so all would go
merrily on, with unlimited bread and cheese, bacon and ale, and
tobacco&mdash;into the blue away!</p>
<p>I regret to say that Matthew expected to inherit the
donkey.</p>
<p>About this time, as all my friends went hunting once or twice
a week, I determined to do the same.&nbsp; Now, as I had never
been a good rider, and had anything but an English seat in the
saddle, I went to a riding-school and underwent a thorough course
both on the pig-skin and bare-backed.&nbsp; My teacher, Mr.
Goodchild, said eventually of me that I was the only person whom
he had ever known who had at my time of life learned to ride
well.&nbsp; But to do this I gave my whole mind and soul to it;
and Goodchild&rsquo;s standard, and still more that of his
riding-master, who had been a captain in a cavalry regiment, was
very high.&nbsp; I used to feel quite as if I were a boy again,
and one under pretty severe discipline at that, when the Captain
was drilling me.&nbsp; For his life he could not treat his pupils
otherwise than as recruits.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit up straighter,
sir!&nbsp; Do you call <i>that</i> sitting up?&nbsp;
<i>That&rsquo;s</i> not the way to hold your arms!&nbsp; Knees
in!&nbsp; <!-- page 420--><a name="page420"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 420</span>Why, sir, when I was learning to
ride I was made to put shillings between my knees and the side,
and if I dropped one <i>I forfeited it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in due time came the meets, and the fox and hare hunting,
during which I found my way, I believe, into every village or
nook for twenty miles round.&nbsp; By this time I had forgotten
all my troubles, mental or physical, and after riding six or
seven hours in a soft fog, would come home the picture of
health.</p>
<p>I remember that one very cold morning I was riding alone to
the meet on a monstrous high black horse which Goodchild had
bought specially for me, when I met two gypsy women, full blood,
selling wares, among them woollen mittens&mdash;just what I
wanted, for my hands were almost frozen in Paris kids.&nbsp; The
women did not know me, but I knew them by description, and great
was the amazement of one when I addressed her by name and in
Romany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pen a mandy</i>, <i>Priscilla Cooper</i>, <i>sa buti
me sosti del tute for adovo pustini vashtini</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Tell me, Priscilla Cooper, how much should I give you for those
woollen gloves?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen pence, master.&rdquo;&nbsp; The common price
was ninepence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will <i>not</i> give you eighteen pence,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how much <i>will</i> you give, master?&rdquo;
asked Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Four shillings</i> will I give, and not a penny
less&mdash;<i>miri pen</i>&mdash;you may take it or leave
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went off with the gloves, while the women roared out
blessings in Romany.&nbsp; There was something in the whole style
of the gift, or the <i>manner</i> of giving it, which was
specially gratifying to gypsies, and the account thereof soon
spread far and wide over the roads as a beautiful deed.</p>
<p>The fraternity of the roads is a strange thing.&nbsp; Once
when I lived at Walton there was an old gypsy woman named Lizzie
Buckland who often camped near us.&nbsp; A good and winsome young
lady named Lillie Doering had taken a liking <!-- page 421--><a
name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 421</span>to the old
lady, and sent her a nice Christmas present of clothing, tea,
&amp;c., which was sent to me to give to the Egyptian
mother.&nbsp; But when I went to seek her, she had flown over the
hills and far away.&nbsp; It made no difference.&nbsp; I walked
on till I met a perfect stranger to me, a woman, but
&ldquo;evidently a traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is old
Liz?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somewhere about four miles
beyond Moulsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a present for
her; are you going that way?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not exactly, but
I&rsquo;ll take it to her; a few miles don&rsquo;t
signify.&rdquo;&nbsp; I learned that it had gone from hand to
hand and been safely delivered.&nbsp; It seems a strange way to
deliver valuables, to walk forth and give them to the first tramp
whom you meet; but I knew my people.</p>
<p>I may here say that during this and the previous winter I had
practised wood-carving.&nbsp; In which, as in studying Gypsy, I
had certain ultimate aims, which were fully developed in later
years.&nbsp; I have several times observed in this record that
when I get an idea I cherish it, think it over, and work it
up.&nbsp; Out of this wood-carving and <i>repouss&eacute;</i> and
the designing which it involved I in time developed ideas which
led to what I may fairly call a great result.</p>
<p>We remained at Brighton until February, when we went to London
and stayed at the Langham Hotel.&nbsp; Then began the London life
of visits, dinners, and for me, as usual, of literary work.&nbsp;
In those days I began to meet and know Professor E. H. Palmer,
Walter Besant, Walter H. Pollock, and many other men of the time
of whom I shall anon have more to say.&nbsp; I arranged with Mr.
Tr&uuml;bner as to the publication of &ldquo;The English
Gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think it was at this time that I dined
one evening at Sir Charles Dilke&rsquo;s, where a droll incident
took place.&nbsp; There was present a small Frenchman, to whom I
had not been introduced, and whose name therefore I did not
know.&nbsp; After dinner in the smoking-room I turned over with
this gentleman a very curious collection of the works of Blake,
which were new to him.&nbsp; Finding that he evidently knew
something about art, I explained to him that <!-- page 422--><a
name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 422</span>Blake was a
very strange visionary&mdash;that he believed that the spirits of
the dead appeared to him, and that he took their portraits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;&eacute;tait donc un fou</i>,&rdquo;
remarked the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Non</i>, Monsieur,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;he was
not a madman.&nbsp; He was almost a genius.&nbsp; Indeed,
<i>c&rsquo;&eacute;tait un Dor&eacute; manqu&eacute;</i>&rdquo;
(he was all but a Dor&eacute;).</p>
<p>There was a roar of laughter from all around, and I,
innocently supposing that I had said something clever unawares,
laughed too.</p>
<p>After all had departed, and I was smoking alone with Sir
Charles, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you think of Dor&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dor&eacute;!&rdquo; I replied astonished, &ldquo;why, I
never saw Dor&eacute; in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Dor&eacute; to whom you were talking,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; was my answer, &ldquo;then it is all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose that Dor&eacute; believed that I knew at the time
who he was.&nbsp; Had he been aware that I did not know who he
was, the compliment would have seemed much stronger.</p>
<p>I have either been introduced to, conversed with, or been well
acquainted at one time or another with Sir John Millais, Holman
Hunt, the Rossettis, Frith, Whistler, Poynter, Du Maurier,
Charles Keene, Boughton, Hodges, Tenniel (who set my motive of
&ldquo;Ping-Wing,&rdquo; as I may say, to music in a cartoon in
<i>Punch</i>), the Hon. John Collier, Rivi&egrave;re, Walter
Crane, and of course many more&mdash;or less&mdash;here and there
in the club, or at receptions.&nbsp; Could I have then foreseen
or imagined that I should ever become&mdash;albeit in a very
humble grade&mdash;an artist myself, and that my works on design
and the minor arts would form the principal portion of my
writings and of my life&rsquo;s work, I should assuredly have
made a greater specialty of such society.&nbsp; But at this time
I could hardly draw, save in very humble fashion indeed, and
little dreamed that I should execute for expensive works
illustrations which <!-- page 423--><a name="page423"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 423</span>would be praised by my critics, as
strangely happened to my &ldquo;Gypsy Sorcery.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
we never know what may befall us.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, little did my mother think,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The day she cradled me,<br />
The lands that I should travel in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the sights that I should see;<br />
Or gae rovin&rsquo; about wi&rsquo; gypsy carles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sic like companie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the <i>Noctes</i> varies it.&nbsp; For it actually came to
pass that a very well-known man of letters, while he, with the
refined politeness characteristic of his style, spoke of mine as
&ldquo;rigmarole,&rdquo; still praised my pictures.</p>
<p>In April we went to Leamington to pay a visit to a Mr. Field,
where we also met his brother, my old friend Leonard Field, whom
I had known in Paris in 1848.&nbsp; During this, journey we
visited Kenilworth, the town and castle of Warwick,
Stratford-on-Avon, and all therewith connected.&nbsp; At the
Easter spring-tide, when primroses first flush by running waters,
and there are many long bright sunny days in the land, while
birdes&rsquo; songs do ripple in the aire, it is good roaming or
resting in such a country, among old castles, towers, and hamlets
quaint and grey.&nbsp; To him who can think and feel, it is like
the reading of marvellously pleasant old books, some in
Elizabethan type, some in earlier black letter, and hearing as we
read sweet music and far-distant chimes.&nbsp; And apropos of
this, I would remark that while I was at Princeton an idea fixed
itself so firmly in my mind that to this day I live on it and act
on it.&nbsp; It is this:&mdash;There is a certain stage to be
reached in reading and reflection, especially if it be aided by
broad &aelig;sthetic culture and science, when every landscape,
event, or human being is or may be to us exactly the same as a
<i>book</i>.&nbsp; For everything in this world which can be
understood and felt can be described, and whatever can be
described may be written and printed.&nbsp; For ordinary people,
no ideas are distinct or concentrated or &ldquo;literary&rdquo;
till they are in black and white; but the scholar or artist in
<!-- page 424--><a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
424</span>words puts thoughts into as clear a form in his own
mind.&nbsp; Having deeply meditated on this idea for forty years,
and been constantly occupied in realising it, I can say truly
that I <i>often</i> compose or think books or monographs which,
though not translated into type, are as absolutely
<i>literature</i> to me as if they were.&nbsp; There is so
<i>much</i> more in this than will at first strike most readers,
that I can not help dwelling on it.&nbsp; It once happened to me
in Philadelphia, in 1850, to pass <i>all</i> the year&mdash;in
fact, nearly two years&mdash;&ldquo;in dusky city pent,&rdquo;
and during all that time I never got a glimpse of the
country.&nbsp; As a director of the Art Union, I was continually
studying pictures, landscapes by great artists, and the
like.&nbsp; The second year, when I went up into Pennsylvania, I
found that I had strangely developed what practically amounted to
a kind of pseudophia.&nbsp; Every fragment of rural scenery,
every rustic &ldquo;bit,&rdquo; every group of shrubs or weeds,
everything, in fact, which recalled pictures, or which could
itself be pictured, appeared to me to be a picture perfectly
executed.&nbsp; This lasted as a vivid or real perception for
about a week, but the memory of it has been in my mind ever
since.&nbsp; It was not so much the beautiful in all Nature which
I saw, as that in Nature which was within the power of the
skilled artist to execute.&nbsp; In like manner the practised
reflector and writer reads books in everything to a degree which
no other person can understand.&nbsp; Wordsworth attained this
stage, and the object of the &ldquo;Excursion&rdquo; is to teach
it.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Letters of James Smetham&rdquo; there is a
passage to the effect that he felt extremely happy among English
hedgerows, and found inexhaustible delight in English birds,
trees, flowers, hills, and brooks, but could not appreciate his
little back-garden with a copper-beech, a weeping-ash, nailed-up
rose trees, and twisting creepers.&nbsp; After I had made a
habit, till it became a passion, of seeking decorative motives,
strange and novel curves&mdash;in short, began to detect the
transcendent alphabet or written language of beauty and mystery
in every plant whatever (of which the alphabet may <!-- page
425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 425</span>be
found in the works of Hulme), I found in every growth of every
kind, yes, in every weed, enough to fill my soul with both art
and poetry; I may say specially in weeds, since in them the
wildest and most graceful motives are more abundant than in
garden flowers.&nbsp; Unto me <i>now</i> anything that grows is,
in simple truth, more than what any landscape once was.&nbsp;
This began in youth in much reading of, and long reflection on,
the signatures, correspondences, and mystical fancies of the
Paracelsian writers&mdash;especially of Gaffarel, of whom I have
a Latin version by me as I write&mdash;and of late years I have
carried its inspiration into decorative art.&nbsp; I have said so
much of this because, as this is an autobiography, I cannot omit
from it something which, unseen in actions, still forms a
predominant motive in my life.&nbsp; It is something which, while
it perfectly embraces <i>all</i> landscaping or picture-making or
dainty delicate cataloguing in poetry, <i>&agrave; la</i> Morris
at times, or like the Squyre of Lowe Degre, in detail, also
involves a far more earnest feeling, and one which combines
thought or <i>religion</i> with emotion, just as a melody which
we associate with a beautiful poem is worth more to us than one
which we do not.&nbsp; Burne Jones is a higher example of
this.</p>
<p>During this season we met at Mrs. Inwood
Jones&rsquo;&mdash;who was a niece of Lady Morgan and had many
interesting souvenirs of her aunt&mdash;several people of note,
among whom was Mme. Taglioni, now a very agreeable and graceful
though naturally elderly lady.&nbsp; I was charmed with her many
reminiscences of well-known characters, and as I had seen her as
well as Ellsler and all the great <i>ballerine</i> many times, we
had many conferences.&nbsp; Somebody said to her one day,
&ldquo;So you know Mr. Leland?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
replied Taglioni in jest, &ldquo;he was one of my old
lovers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was reported to me, when I said,
&ldquo;I wish she had told me that thirty years
sooner.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1846 Taglioni owned three palaces in
Venice, one of them the Ca&rsquo; d&rsquo;oro, and in 1872 she
was giving lessons in London.&nbsp; At Mrs. Frank Hill&rsquo;s I
made the acquaintance of the marvellously <!-- page 426--><a
name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>clever
Eugene Schuyler, and at Mr. Smalley&rsquo;s of the equally
amazingly cheeky and gifted &ldquo;Joaquin&rdquo; Miller.&nbsp;
Somewhere else I met several times another curious celebrity whom
I had known in America, the Chevalier Wykoff.&nbsp; Though he was
almost the type and proverb of an adventurer, I confess that I
always liked him.&nbsp; He was gentlemanly and kind in his
manner, and agreeable and intelligent in conversation.&nbsp;
Though he had been Fanny Ellsler&rsquo;s agent or secretary, and
written those two curiously cool works, &ldquo;Souvenirs of a
Roving Diplomatist&rdquo; (he had been employed by Palmerston)
and &ldquo;My Courtship and its Consequences&rdquo; (in reference
to his having been imprisoned in Italy for attempting to carry
off an elderly heiress), he was also the author of a really
admirable work on the political system of the United States,
which any man may read to advantage.&nbsp; A century ago or more
he would have been a great man in his way.&nbsp; He knew
everybody.&nbsp; I believe that as General Tevis formed his bold
ideal of life from much reading of <i>condottieri</i> or military
adventurers, and Robert Hunt from Cooper&rsquo;s novels, so
Wykoff got his inspiration for a career from studying and
admiring the diplomatic <i>parvenus</i> of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; These <i>Boh&eacute;miens de la haute
vol&eacute;e</i>, who drew their first motives from study, are by
far more interesting and tolerable than those of an illiterate
type.</p>
<p>One summer when I was at Bateman&rsquo;s, near Newport, with
G. H. Boker, Robert Leroy, and our wives, Leroy reported one day
that he had seen Wykoff, Hiram Fuller, a certain very dashing
<i>prima donna</i>, and two other notorieties sitting side by
side in a row on the steps of the Ocean House.&nbsp; I remarked
that if there had only been with them the devil and Lola Montez,
the party would have been complete.&nbsp; Leroy was famous for
his quaint <i>mots</i>, in which he had a counterpart in
&ldquo;Tom Appleton,&rdquo; of Boston, whom I also knew very
well.&nbsp; The Appletoniana and Leroyalties which were current
in the Sixties would make a lively book.</p>
<p>I remember that one evening at a dinner at
Tr&uuml;bner&rsquo;s in <!-- page 427--><a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>this year
there were present M. Van der Weyer, G. H. Lewes, and M.
Delepierre.&nbsp; I have rarely heard so much good talk in the
same time.&nbsp; Thoughts so gay and flashes so refined, such a
mingling of choice literature, brilliant anecdote, and happy
jests, are seldom heard as I heard them.&nbsp; <i>Tempi
passati</i>!</p>
<p>Apropos of George H. Boker and Leroy, I may here remark that
they were both strikingly tall and <i>distingu&eacute;</i> men,
but that when they dressed themselves for bass-fishing, and
&ldquo;put on mean attire,&rdquo; they seemed to be common
fisher-folk.&nbsp; One day, while fishing on the rocks, there
came up the elegant <i>prima donna</i> referred to, who, seeing
that they had very fine lobsters, ordered them to be taken to the
hotel for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered Leroy brusquely; &ldquo;we want them
for bait.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady swept away indignantly.&nbsp; To
her succeeded Ralph Waldo Emerson, who did not know them
personally, and who began to put to Mr. Boker questions as to his
earnings and his manner of life, to all of which Mr. Boker
replied with great <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Mr. B.,
however, had on his pole a silver reel, which had cost &pound;30
($150), and at last Mr. Emerson&rsquo;s eye rested on that, and
word no more spoke he, but, with a smile and bowing very
politely, went his road.&nbsp; <i>Ultimam dixit salutem</i>.</p>
<p>One evening I was sitting in the smoking-room of the Langham
Hotel, when an American said to me, &ldquo;I hear that Charles
Leland, who wrote &lsquo;Breitmann,&rsquo; is staying
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could you point him out to me?&rdquo; asked
the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so with pleasure&mdash;in
fact, if you will tell me your name, I think I can manage to
introduce you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The American was very grateful for
this, and asked when it would be.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Now</i> is the
time,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for I am he.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another
occasion another stranger told me, that having heard that Mr.
Leland was in the smoking-room, he had come in to see him, and
asked me to point him out.&nbsp; I pointed to myself, at which he
was much astonished, and then, apologetically and half ashamed,
said, &ldquo;Who do <!-- page 428--><a name="page428"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 428</span>you really suppose, of all the men
here present, I had settled on as being you?&rdquo;&nbsp; I could
not conjecture, when he pointed to a great broom-bearded,
broad-shouldered, jovial, intemperate, German-looking man, and
said, &ldquo;There!&nbsp; I thought that must be the author of
&lsquo;Hans Brietmann.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Which suggested to me
the idea, &ldquo;Does the public, then, generally believe that
poets look like their heroes?&rdquo;&nbsp; One can indeed imagine
Longfellow as Poor Henry of the &ldquo;Golden Legend,&rdquo; but
few would expect to find the counterpart of Biglow in a
Lowell.&nbsp; And yet this belief or instinct is in every case a
<i>great</i> compliment, for it testifies that there is that in
the poem which is inspired by Nature and originality, and that it
is not all mere art-work or artificial.&nbsp; And it is true that
by some strange law, name, body, and soul generally do preserve
some kind of unity in the realm of literature.&nbsp; There has
never been, as yet, a really great Gubbins or Podgers in poetry,
or Boggs in romance; and if literature has its Hogg, let it be
remembered that the wild boar in all Northern sagas and
chronicles, like the Eber in Germany, or the Wolf, was a name of
pride and honour, as seen in Eberstein.&nbsp; The Whistler of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s is one of the most eccentric and original of
Scott&rsquo;s characters, and the Whistler of St. Luke&rsquo;s,
or the patron saint of painting, is in no respect deficient in
these noble qualifications.&nbsp; The Seven Whistlers who fly
unseen by night, ever piping a wild nocturne, are the most
uncanny of birds, while there is, to my mind, something
absolutely grotesquely awful (as in many of &ldquo;Dreadful
Jemmy&rsquo;s&rdquo; pictures) in the narration that in ancient
days the immense army of the Mexican Indians marched forth to
battle all whistling in unison&mdash;probably a symphony in
blood-colour.&nbsp; Fancy half a million of Whistlers on the
war-path, about to do battle to the death with as many
Ruskins&mdash;I mean red-skins!&nbsp; <i>Nomen est omen</i>.</p>
<p>One of the most charming persons whom I ever met in my life
was the Hon. Mrs. Caroline Norton, and one of the most delightful
dinners at which my wife and I were ever <!-- page 429--><a
name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 429</span>present was
at her house.&nbsp; As I had been familiar with her poems from my
boyhood, I was astonished to find her still so beautiful and
young&mdash;if my memory does not deceive me, I thought her far
younger looking than myself.&nbsp; I owe her this compliment, for
I can recall her speaking with great admiration of Mrs. Leland to
Lord Houghton and &ldquo;Bulwer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Norton had not only a graceful, fascinating expression of
figure and motion, but narrated everything so well as to cast a
peculiar life and interest into the most trifling anecdote.&nbsp;
I remember one of the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Houghton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;calls you, Mr.
Leland, the poet of jargons.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He indeed introduced
me to all his guests once by this term.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Jargon is a
confusion of language, and I have a maid who lives in a jargon of
ideas&mdash;as to values.&nbsp; The other day she broke to utter
ruin an antique vase&rdquo;&mdash;(I do not accurately recall
what the object was)&mdash;&ldquo;which cost four hundred pounds,
and when I said that it was such a grief to me to lose it, she
replied, while weeping, &lsquo;Oh, do not mind it, my lady;
<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> buy you just such another,&rsquo; as if it were
worth tenpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Norton had marvellously beautiful and expressive eyes,
such as one seldom meets thrice in a life.&nbsp; As a harp well
played inspires tears or the impulse to dance, so her glances
conveyed, almost in the same instant, deep emotion and exquisite
merriment.&nbsp; I remember that she was much amused with some of
my American jests and reminiscences, and was always prompt to
respond, <i>eodem genere</i>.&nbsp; So nightingale the wodewale
answereth.</p>
<p>During this season in London I met Thomas Carlyle.&nbsp; Our
mutual friend, Moncure Conway, had arranged that I should call on
the great writer at the house of the latter in Chelsea.&nbsp; I
went there at about eleven in the morning, and when Mr. Carlyle
entered the room I was amazed&mdash;I may say almost
awed&mdash;by something which was altogether unexpected, and this
was his <i>extraordinary</i> likeness to my late <!-- page
430--><a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
430</span>father.&nbsp; A slight resemblance to Carlyle may be
seen in my own profile, but had he been with my father, the pair
might have passed for twins; and in iron-grey grimness and the
never-to-be-convinced expression of the eyes they were identity
itself.</p>
<p>I can only remember that for the first twenty or thirty
minutes Mr. Carlyle talked such a lot of skimble-skamble stuff
and rubbish, which sounded like the very <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and
lees of his &ldquo;Latter-Day Pamphlets,&rdquo; that I began to
suspect that he was quizzing me, or that this was the manner in
which he ladled out Carlyleism to visitors who came to be
Carlyled and acted unto.&nbsp; It struck me as if Mr. Tennyson,
bored with lion-hunting guests, had begun to repeat his poetry to
them out of sheer sarcasm, or as if he felt, &ldquo;Well,
you&rsquo;ve come to <i>see</i> and <i>hear</i> me&mdash;a
poet&mdash;so take your poetry, and be d---d to you!&rdquo;&nbsp;
However, it may be I felt a coming wrath, and the Socratic demon
or gypsy <i>dook</i>, which often rises in me on such occasions,
and never deceives me, gave me a strong premonition that there
was to be, if not an exemplary row, at least a lively incident
which was to put a snapped end to this humbugging.</p>
<p>It came thus.&nbsp; All at once Mr. Carlyle abruptly asked me,
in a manner or with an intonation which sounded to me almost
semi-contemptuous, &ldquo;And what kind of an American may you
be?&rdquo;&nbsp; (I <i>think</i> he said &ldquo;will you
be?&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;German, or Irish, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied, not over amiably:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it interests you, Mr. Carlyle, to know the origin
of my family, I may say that I am descended from Henry Leland,
whom the tradition declares to have been a noted Puritan, and
active in the politics of his time,&rsquo; and who went to
America in 1636.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Mr. Carlyle replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether any of your family have since been
equal to your old Puritan great-grandfather&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;done anything to equal your old Puritan
grandfather&rdquo;).&nbsp; With this <!-- page 431--><a
name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 431</span>something
to the effect that we had done nothing in America since
Cromwell&rsquo;s Revolution, equal to it in importance or of any
importance.</p>
<p>Then a great rage came over me, and I remember <i>very</i>
distinctly that there flashed through my mind in a second the
reflection, &ldquo;Now, if I have to call you a d---d old fool
for saying that, I <i>will</i>; but I&rsquo;ll be even with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; When as quickly the following inspiration came,
which I uttered, and I suspect somewhat energetically:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carlyle, I think that my brother, Henry Leland, who
got the wound from which he died standing by my side in the war
of the rebellion, fighting against slavery, was worth ten of my
old Puritan ancestors; at least, he died in a ten times better
cause.&nbsp; And&rdquo; (here my old &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; was up
and I let it out) &ldquo;allow me to say, Mr. Carlyle, that I
think that in all matters of historical criticism you are
principally influenced by the merely melodramatic and
theatrical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Carlyle, looking utterly amazed and startled, though
not at all angry, said, for the first time, in broad
Scotch&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whot&rsquo;s <i>thot</i> ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Carlyle,&rdquo; I exclaimed with rising
wrath, &ldquo;that I consider that in all historical judgments
you are influenced only by the melodramatic and
theatrical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grim smile as of admiration came over the stern old
face.&nbsp; Whether he really felt the justice of the hit I know
not, but he was evidently pleased at the manner in which it was
delivered, and it was with a deeply reflective and not displeased
air that he replied, still in Scotch&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na, na, I&rsquo;m nae <i>thot</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the terrier who had ferociously attacked the lion, and
the lion was charmed.&nbsp; From that instant he was courteous,
companionable, and affable, and talked as if we had been long
acquainted, and as if he liked me.&nbsp; It occurred to me that
the resemblance of Carlyle to my father during the row was
appalling, the difference being that my father <i>never</i> <!--
page 432--><a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
432</span>gave in.&nbsp; It would have been an awful sight to see
and a sound to hear if the two could have &ldquo;discussed&rdquo;
some subject on which they were equally informed&mdash;say the
American tariff or slavery.</p>
<p>After a while Mr. Froude the historian came in, and we all
went out together for a walk in the Park.&nbsp; Pausing on the
bridge, Mr. Carlyle called my attention to the very rural English
character of a part of the scenery in the distance, where a
church-spire rises over ranges of tree-tops.&nbsp; I observed
that the smoke of a gypsy fire and a tent by a hedge was all that
was needed.&nbsp; Then we began to talk about gypsies, and I told
Mr. Carlyle that I could talk Romany, and ran on with some
reminiscences, whereat, as I now recall, though I did not note it
then, his amusement at or interest in me seemed to be much
increased, as if I had unexpectedly turned out to be something a
little out of the ordinary line of tourist interviewers; and
truly in those days Romany ryes were not so common as they now
are.&nbsp; Then Mr. Carlyle himself told a story, how his
father&mdash;if I remember rightly&mdash;had once lent a large
sum to or trusted a gypsy in some extraordinary manner.&nbsp; It
befell in after days that the lender was himself in sore straits,
when the gypsy took him by night to a hut, and digging up or
lifting the <i>hard-stane</i> or hearth-stone, took out a bag of
guineas, which he transferred to his benefactor.</p>
<p>We parted, and this was the only time I ever conversed with
Mr. Carlyle, though I saw him subsequently on more than one
occasion.&nbsp; He sent word specially by Mr. Conway to me that
he would be pleased to have me call again; but &ldquo;once bitten
twice shy,&rdquo; and I had not so much enjoyed my call as to
wish to repeat it.&nbsp; But I believe that what Mr. Carlyle
absolutely needed above all things on earth was somebody to put
on the gloves with him metaphorically about once a day, and give
and take a few thumping blows; nor do I believe that he would
have shrunk from a tussle <i>&agrave; la Choctaw</i>, with
biting, gouging, tomahawk and scalper, for he had <!-- page
433--><a name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 433</span>an
uncommonly <i>dour</i> look about the eyes, and must have been a
magnificent fighter when once roused.&nbsp; But though I had not
his vast genius nor wit, I had the great advantage of having
often had very severe differences with my father, who was, I
believe, as much Carlyled by Nature as Carlyle himself, if not
more so, whereas it is morally impossible that the Sage of
Chelsea could ever have found any one like himself to train
under.&nbsp; But to Carlyle people in conversation requires
constant practice with a master&mdash;<i>consuetudine quotidiana
cum aliquo congredi</i>&mdash;and he had for so long a time
knocked everybody down without meeting the least resistance, that
victory had palled upon him, and he had, so to speak,
&ldquo;vinegared&rdquo; on himself.&nbsp; With somebody to
&ldquo;sass him back,&rdquo; Carlyle would have been cured of the
dyspepsia, and have lived twenty years longer.</p>
<p>Carlyle&rsquo;s was and ever will be one of the greatest names
in English literature, and it is very amusing to observe how the
gossip-makers, who judge of genius by tittle-tattle and petty
personal defects, have condemned him <i>in toto</i> because he
was not an angel to a dame who was certainly a bit of a
<i>diablesse</i>.&nbsp; Thus I find in a late very popular
collection the remark that&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is curious to note in the &lsquo;Life and
Correspondence of Lord Houghton&rsquo; the high estimation in
which Carlyle was held by him.&nbsp; His regard and admiration
cannot but seem exaggerated, now that we know so much of the
Chelsea philosopher&rsquo;s real character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is <i>quite</i> the moral old lady, who used to think
that Raphael was a good painter &ldquo;till she read all about
that nasty Fornarina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another hard old character with whom I became
acquainted in those days, and one who, though not a Carlyle,
still, like him, exercised in a peculiar way a great influence on
English literature.&nbsp; This was George Borrow.&nbsp; I was in
the habit of reading a great deal in the British Museum, where he
also came, and there I was introduced to him.</p>
<p><!-- page 434--><a name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
434</span>He was busy with a venerable-looking volume in old
Irish and made the remark to me that he did not believe there was
a man living who could read old Irish with ease (which I now
observe to myself was &ldquo;fished&rdquo; out of Sir W.
Betham).&nbsp; We discussed several gypsy words and
phrases.&nbsp; I met him in the same place several times.&nbsp;
He was a tall, large, fine-looking man, who must have been
handsome in his youth.&nbsp; I knew at the time in London a Mr.
Kerrison, who had been as a very young man, probably in the
Twenties, very intimate with Borrow.&nbsp; He told me that one
night Borrow acted very wildly, whooping and vociferating so as
to cause the police to follow him, and after a long run led them
to the edge of the Thames, &ldquo;and there they thought they had
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he plunged boldly into the water and swam
in his clothes to the opposite shore, and so escaped.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For he fled o&rsquo;er to t&rsquo;other
side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they could not find him;<br />
He swam across the flowing tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never looked behind him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About this time (1826?) George Borrow published a small book
of poems which is now extremely rare.&nbsp; I have a copy of
it.&nbsp; In it there is a lyric in which, with his usual
effrontery, he describes a very clever, tall, handsome,
accomplished man, who knows many languages and who can drink a
pint of rum, ending with the remark that he himself was this
admirable person.&nbsp; As Heine was in England at this time, it
is not improbable that he met with this poem; but in any case,
there is a resemblance between it and one of his own in the
<i>Buch der Lieder</i>, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brave man, he got me the food I ate,<br />
His kindness and care I can never forget,<br />
Yet I cannot kiss him, though other folk can,<br />
For I myself am this excellent man!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It came to pass that after a while I wrote my book on
&ldquo;The English Gypsies and their Language,&rdquo; and sent a
note <!-- page 435--><a name="page435"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 435</span>to Mr. Borrow in which I asked
permission to dedicate it to him.&nbsp; I sent it to the care of
Mr. Murray, who subsequently assured me that Mr. Borrow had
actually received it.&nbsp; Now Mr. Borrow had written thirty
years before some sketches and fragments on the same subject,
which would, I am very certain, have remained unpublished to this
day but for me.&nbsp; He received my note on Saturday&mdash;never
answered it&mdash;and on Monday morning advertised in all the
journals his own forthcoming work on the same subject.</p>
<p>Now, what is sincere truth is, that when I learned this I
laughed.&nbsp; I thought very little of my own work, and if Mr.
Borrow had only told me that it was in the way of his I would
have withdrawn it at once, and that with right goodwill, for I
had so great a respect for the Nestor of gypsyism that I would
have been very glad to have gratified him with such a small
sacrifice.&nbsp; But it was not in him to suspect or imagine so
much common decency in any human heart, and so he craftily, and
to my great delight and satisfaction, &ldquo;got ahead&rdquo; of
me.&nbsp; For, to tell the truth of truth, I was pleased to my
soul that I had caused him to make and publish the work.</p>
<p>I have said too hastily that it was written thirty years
before.&nbsp; What I believe is, that Mr. Borrow had by him a
vocabulary, and a few loose sketches, which he pitchforked
together, but that the book itself was made and cemented into one
with additions for the first time after he received my
note.&nbsp; He was not, take him altogether,
over-scrupulous.&nbsp; Sir Patrick Colquhoun told me that once
when he was at Constantinople, Mr. Borrow came there, and gave it
out that he was a marvellous Oriental scholar.&nbsp; But there
was great scepticism on this subject at the Legation, and one day
at the <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, where the great writer
and divers young diplomatists dined, two who were seated on
either side of Borrow began to talk in Arabic, speaking to him,
the result being that he was obliged to confess that he not only
did not understand what they were saying, but did not even know
<!-- page 436--><a name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
436</span>what the language was.&nbsp; Then he was tried in
Modern Greek, with the same result.&nbsp; The truth was that he
knew a great deal, but did all in his power to make the world
believe it was far more&mdash;like the African king, or the
English prime minister, who, the longer his shirts were made,
insisted on having the higher collars, until the former trailed
on the ground and the latter rose above the top of his
head&mdash;&ldquo;when they came home from the wash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I admire in Borrow to such a degree that before it his
faults or failings seem very trifling, is his absolutely
vigorous, marvellously varied originality, based on direct
familiarity with Nature, but guided and cultured by the study of
natural, simple writers, such as Defoe and Smollett.&nbsp; I
think that the &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in or rather sympathy for
gypsies, in his case as in mine, came not from their being
curious or dramatic beings, but because they are so much a part
of free life, of out-of-doors Nature; so associated with
sheltered nooks among rocks and trees, the hedgerow and birds,
river-sides, and wild roads.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s heart was large
and true as regarded English rural life; there was a place in it
for everything which was of the open air and freshly
beautiful.&nbsp; He was not a view-hunter of &ldquo;bits,&rdquo;
trained according to Ruskin and the <i>deliberate</i>
word-painting of a thousand novels and Victorian picturesque
poems; but he often brings us nearer to Nature than they do, not
by photography, but by casually letting fall a word or trait, by
which we realise not only her form but her soul.&nbsp; Herein he
was like Washington Irving, who gives us the impression of a
writer who was deeply inspired with calm sweet sunny views of
Nature, yet in whose writings literal description is so rarely
introduced, that it is a marvel how much the single buttercup
lights up the landscape for a quarter of a mile, when a thousand
would produce no effect whatever.&nbsp; This may have possibly
been art in Irving&mdash;art of the most subtle kind&mdash;but in
Borrow it was instinct, and hardly intentional.&nbsp; In this
respect he was superior even to Whitman.</p>
<p><!-- page 437--><a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
437</span>And here I would say, apropos of Carlyle, Tennyson,
Irving, Borrow, Whitman, and some others whom I have met, that
with such men in only one or two interviews, one covers more
ground and establishes more intimacy than with the great majority
of folk whom we meet and converse with hundreds of times.&nbsp;
Which fact has been set forth by Wieland in his work on
Democritus or the Abderites so ingeniously, as people expressed
it a century ago, or so cleverly, as we now say, or so
sympathetically, as an Italian would say, that my pen fails to
utter the thoughts which arise in me compared to what he has
written.</p>
<p>When the summer came, or on the 1st of August, we started on a
grand tour about England.&nbsp; First we went to Salisbury.&nbsp;
I was deeply interested in the Cathedral there, because it is
possibly the only great Gothic structure of the kind in Europe
which was completed in a single style during a single
reign.&nbsp; Stonehenge was to me even more remarkable, because
it is more mysterious.&nbsp; Its stupendous barbarism or archaic
character, involving a whole lost cycle of ideas, contrasts so
strangely with the advanced architectural skill displayed in the
cutting and fitting of the vast blocks, that the whole seems to
be a mighty paradox.&nbsp; This was the work of many thousands of
men&mdash;of very well directed labour under the supervision of
architects who could draw and measure skilfully with a grand
sense of <i>proportion</i> or symmetry, who had, however, not
attained to ornament&mdash;a thing without parallel in
humanity.&nbsp; This is absolutely bewildering, as is the utter
want of all indication as to its real purpose.&nbsp; The old
British tradition that the stones were brought by magic from
Africa, coupled with what Sir John Lubbock and others declare as
to similar remains on the North African coast, suggest something,
but what that was remains to be discovered.&nbsp; Men have,
however, developed great works of the massive and simple order in
poetry, as well as in architecture.&nbsp; The Nibelungen Lied is
a Stonehenge.&nbsp; There are in it only one or two similes or
decorations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Simplicity is its sole
ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 438--><a name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
438</span>From Salisbury we went to Wells.&nbsp; The cathedrals
of England form the pages of a vast work in which there is
written the history of a paradox or enigma as marvellous as that
of Stonehenge; and it is this&mdash;that the farther back we go,
even into a really barbarous age, almost to the time when Roman
culture had died and the medi&aelig;val had not begun, the more
exquisite are the proportions of buildings, the higher their
tone, and, as in the case of Early and Decorated English, the
more beautiful their ornament.&nbsp; That is to say, that exactly
in the time when, according to all our modern teaching and ideas,
there should have been <i>no</i> architectural art, it was most
admirably developed, while, on the contrary, in this end of the
nineteenth century, when theory, criticism, learning, and science
abound, it is in its lowest and most depraved state, its highest
flights aiming at nothing better than cheap imitation of old
examples.&nbsp; The age which produced the Romanesque
architecture, whether in northern Italy, along the Rhine as the
Lombard, or in France and England as Norman, was extremely
barbarous, bloody, and illiterate; and yet in the noblest and
grandest conceptions of architectural art it surpassed all the
genius of this our time as the sun surpasses a star.&nbsp; While
we <i>know</i> that man has advanced, it still remains true that
the history of architecture alone for the past thousand years
indicates a steady retrogression and decay in art, and this
constitutes the stupendous paradox to which I have alluded.&nbsp;
But Milton has fully explained to us that when the devils in hell
built the first great temple or
palace&mdash;Pandemonium&mdash;they achieved the greatest work of
architecture ever seen!</p>
<p>York Cathedral made on me a hundred times deeper and more
sympathetic impression than St. Peter&rsquo;s of Rome.&nbsp;
There is a grandeur of unity and a sense of a single cultus in it
which the Renaissance never reached in anything.&nbsp; Even from
the days of Orcagna there is an element of mixed motives and
incoherence in the best of Italian architecture and
sculpture.&nbsp; It requires colour to effect that which Norman
<!-- page 439--><a name="page439"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
439</span>or Gothic art could produce more grandly and
impressively with <i>shade</i> alone.&nbsp; It is the difference
between a garden and a forest.&nbsp; This is shown in the
glorious medi&aelig;val <i>grisaille</i> windows, in which such
art proves its absolute perfection.&nbsp; While I was looking at
these in rapt admiration, an American friend who did not lack a
certain degree of culture asked me if I did not find in them a
great want of colour!</p>
<p>I made in York the acquaintance of a youth named Carr, son of
a former high sheriff, who, by the way, showed us very great
hospitality whenever we visited the city.&nbsp; This young man
had read Labarthe and other writers on arch&aelig;ology, and was
enthusiastic in finding relics of the olden time.&nbsp; He took
me into a great many private houses.&nbsp; I visited every
church, and indeed saw far more than do the great majority of
even the most inquiring visitors.&nbsp; The Shambles was then and
is still perhaps one of the most curious specimens of a small
medi&aelig;val street in the world.&nbsp; I felt as if I could
pass a life in the museum and churches, and I did, in fact, years
after, remain there, very busy, for three weeks, sketching
innumerable corbels, gargoyles, goblins, arches, weather-worn
saints and sinners.&nbsp; And in the Cathedral I found the
original of the maid in the garden a-hanging out the
clothes.&nbsp; She is a fair sinner, and the blackbird is a demon
volatile, who, having lighted on her shoulder, snaps her by the
nose to get her soul.&nbsp; The motive often occurs in Gothic
sculpture.</p>
<p>We may trace it back&mdash;<i>vide</i> the &ldquo;Pharaohs,
Fellahs, and Explorers&rdquo; of Amelia B. Edwards (whom I have
also met at an Oriental Congress)&mdash;to Roman Harpies and the
Egyptian <i>Ba</i>, depicted in the &ldquo;Book of the
Dead&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Egyptian Bible.&rdquo;</p>

more about this celebrated fireplace, I inserted a request in the
<i>Public Ledger</i> for information regarding it, which elicited
the following from some one to me unknown, to whom I now return
thanks:&mdash;</p>

to the designation &lsquo;Antiquarian,&rsquo; as I get older I
still take a great interest in the early history of our beloved
city.&nbsp; I remember <i>distinctly</i> the fact, but not the
date, of reading a description of the
&lsquo;mantelpiece.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was of wood, handsomely
carved on the pillars, and under the shelf, and on the centre
between the pillars, was the following quaint and witty
<i>hieroglyphic</i> inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>When the grate is M. T. put:<br />

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Frankford</i>, <i>May

<p>I can add to this, that the chimney-piece was originally made
for wood-fires, and that long after a grate was set in and the
inscription added.</p>

in one copy.&nbsp; De Quincey was proud of his descent from De la
Laund.&nbsp; I may here say that John Leyland, who is a
painstaking and conscientious antiquarian and accomplished
genealogist, has been much impressed with the extraordinary
similarity of disposition, tastes, and pursuits which has
characterised the Lelands for centuries.&nbsp; Any stranger
knowing us would think that he and I were nearly related.&nbsp;
It is told of the manor of Leyland that during the early Middle
Ages it was attempted to build a church there in a certain place,
but every morning the stones were found to be removed.&nbsp;
Finally, it was completed, but the next dawn beheld the whole
edifice removed to the other spot, while a spirit-voice was heard
to call (one account says that the words were found on a mystic
scroll):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here shall itt bee,<br />
And here shall itt stande;<br />
And this shall bee called:<br />
Ye Churche of Leyland.&rdquo;</p>

<i>Kenelm Chillingly</i>.&nbsp; I had long before the publication
of the work conversed with Lord Lytton on the subject&mdash;which
is also touched on in my <i>Sketch-Book of Meister Karl</i>, of
which the illustrious author had a copy.</p>

by a most appropriately odd coincidence or mere chance, I have
received with delight a copy of this work from Jesse Jaggard, a
well-known dealer in literary curiosities in Liverpool, who makes
a specialty of <i>hunting up</i> rarities to order, which is of
itself a quaint business.&nbsp; The book is entitled
&ldquo;Curiosities for the Ingenious, Selected from the Most
Authentic Treasures of Nature, Science and Art, Biography,
History, and General Literature.&nbsp; London: Thomas Boys,
Ludgate Hill, 1821.&rdquo;&nbsp; Boys was the publisher of the
celebrated series of &ldquo;The Percy Anecdotes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
should here, in justice to Mr. Jaggard, mention that I am
indebted to him for obtaining for me several rare and singular
works, and that his catalogues are remarkably well edited.</p>

mentioning that Mr. Symonds, not long before his death, wrote a

the people who wanted emancipation, but who did not like to be
called Abolitionists, that they reminded him of the Irishman who
had signed a temperance pledge and did not like to break it, yet
who sadly wanted a &ldquo;drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; So going to an
apothecary he asked for a glass of soda-water, adding,
&ldquo;an&rsquo;, docther dear, if yees could put a little whisky
into it <i>unbeknownst</i> to me, I&rsquo;d be much obliged to
yees.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that I may say that as Mr. Lincoln
read all which I published (as I was well assured), I was the
apothecary here referred to, who administered the whisky of
Abolition disguised in the soda-water of Emancipation.</p>

very remarkable man as a lawyer, and a person of marked
refinement and culture.&nbsp; He became my friend in after years,
as did his son Walter.&nbsp; Both are now departed.&nbsp; I wrote
and publicly read an &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo; address and poem
on his death, in delivering which I had great pains to refrain
from weeping, which was startling to me, not being habitually
expressive of emotion.</p>

of stiff clay, which holds like glue, or, what I think far more
wearisome, urging them along for miles over the heaviest roads or
broken ways, when the poor exhausted mules have almost given
out.&nbsp; Though, as he says, he was only nineteen and seemed
very fragile, the indomitable pluck and perseverance of Gilder in
all such trials were such as to call special commendation from my

who were accustomed to such labour, assembled above and around us
to enjoy the unusual sight of &ldquo;jontlemen&rdquo; digging
like &ldquo;canawlers,&rdquo; and how I, while at my spade,
excited their hilarity and delight by casting at them scraps of
&ldquo;ould Eerish,&rdquo; or Irish.&nbsp; The fight of the
section here alluded to was, I believe, rather of the nature of
an improvised rencontre, albeit two or three rebels were killed
in the artillery duel.&nbsp; Corporal Penington was, I believe,
as usual, the inspiring Mephistopheles of the affair.</p>

in every respect than that of &ldquo;The old guard dies but never

numbers, and has few parallels for sheer audacity, all things
considered, in the history of modern warfare.&nbsp; It passed
into a very widely-spread popular <i>mot</i> in America.&nbsp; It
is more than an <i>on dit</i>, for I was nearly within ear-shot
when it was uttered, and it was promptly repeated to me.&nbsp;
Yet, if my memory serves me right, there is something like this,
&ldquo;Come and take it!&rdquo; recorded in the early Tuscan wars
in Villari&rsquo;s introduction to the &ldquo;Life of
Machiavelli,&rdquo; translated by his accomplished wife.&nbsp; I
have, as I write this note, just had the pleasure of meeting with
the Minister and Madame Villari at a dinner at Senator
Comparetti&rsquo;s in Florence, which is perhaps the reason why I
recall the precedent.&nbsp; And I may also recall as a noteworthy
incident, that at this dinner Professor Milani, the great
Etruscologist and head of the Arch&aelig;ological Museum,
congratulated me very much on having been the first and only
person who ever discovered an old Etruscan word still living in
the traditions of the people&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Intial</i>,
the Spirit of the Haunting Shadow.&nbsp; This is a little
discursive&mdash;<i>mais je prends mon bien o&ugrave; je le
trouve</i>, and it is all autobiographic!&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all
turkey,&rdquo; as the wolf said when he ate the claws.</p>
<p>The proposal of General Smith to resist with us alone the
tremendous maddened rush of half of Lee&rsquo;s veterans has its
re-echo in my ballad, where Breitmann attempts with his Bummers
to stem the great army of the South.&nbsp; The result would have
probably been the same&mdash;that is, we should have been
&ldquo;gobbled up.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he would have undoubtedly
tried it without misgiving.&nbsp; I have elsewhere narrated my
only interview with him.</p>
<p><a name="footnote268"></a><a href="#citation268"

Gettysburg was indeed something to be long and well
remembered.&nbsp; It was so awful that on the field wild rabbits,
appalled by the sound, ran to the gunners and soldiers and tried
to take refuge in their bosoms.&nbsp; Those who have only heard
cannon fired singly, or a single discharge of cannon, can have no
conception of what such sounds when long sustained are like.</p>

and noble work in the war, in the field, and also out of it as a
Government detective, and I am very far from being ashamed to say
that I aided him more than once in the latter capacity.&nbsp;
There was a lady in Philadelphia who availed herself of a
distinguished position in society so as to go and come from
Richmond and act as spy and carry letters between rebel
agents.&nbsp; I knew this and told Olcott of it, who put a stop
to her treason.&nbsp; I also learned that a rascally contractor
had defrauded Government with adulterated chemicals.&nbsp; Olcott
had him heavily fined.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
